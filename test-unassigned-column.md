# Test Report: Unassigned Column Issue Fix

## Issue Description
The calendar's "unassigned" column was appearing initially and then getting hidden when merchant settings were loaded. This created a flickering effect where the column would briefly show and then disappear.

## Root Cause
1. The `showUnassignedColumn` state was initialized to `true` by default in `CalendarProvider.tsx`
2. When merchant settings were loaded, the code tried to call `actions.toggleUnassignedColumn()` which didn't exist
3. The reducer was missing the `TOGGLE_UNASSIGNED` case
4. The action type `SET_UI_FLAGS` was missing from the types definition

## Changes Made

### 1. CalendarProvider.tsx
- Added `TOGGLE_UNASSIGNED` case to the reducer
- Added `toggleUnassignedColumn` action to the actions object
- Added `dispatch` property to actions for direct dispatch access

### 2. types.ts
- Added `SET_UI_FLAGS` action type definition
- Added `dispatch` method to CalendarActions interface

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Default Behavior (Show Unassigned Column)**
   - Clear local storage and cookies
   - Load the calendar page
   - Verify that the unassigned column appears and stays visible
   - Check that unassigned bookings appear in this column

2. **Test Settings Toggle**
   - Go to Settings > Booking Settings
   - Toggle "Show Unassigned Column" OFF
   - Save settings
   - Return to calendar
   - Verify the unassigned column is hidden
   - Toggle it back ON and verify it reappears

3. **Test Persistence**
   - Set "Show Unassigned Column" to OFF
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify the column remains hidden (no flicker)
   - Close and reopen the browser
   - Verify the setting persists

4. **Test with Bookings**
   - Create a booking without assigning staff (unassigned)
   - With column ON: Verify booking appears in unassigned column
   - With column OFF: Verify booking is not displayed
   - Assign the booking to a staff member
   - Verify it moves to the correct staff column

## Expected Behavior
- The unassigned column visibility should match the merchant setting from initial load
- No flickering or temporary display of the column when it should be hidden
- Settings should persist across page refreshes and browser sessions
- Unassigned bookings should only be visible when the column is shown

## Code Flow
1. `CalendarProvider` initializes with default `showUnassignedColumn: true`
2. `useCalendarData` hook loads merchant settings from localStorage/API
3. If settings differ from current state, it dispatches `SET_UI_FLAGS` action
4. Reducer updates the state without flickering
5. `DailyView` renders columns based on `state.showUnassignedColumn`
