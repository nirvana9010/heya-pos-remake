# Multi-Service Booking Test Results

## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Implementation: SUCCESS

### Summary
The multi-service booking feature has been successfully implemented and tested. Users can now book multiple services in a single booking flow.

## Test Results

### 1. API Testing âœ…
```bash
./test-booking-api.sh
```
- **Public endpoints**: All working
- **Multi-service availability**: Correctly checks combined duration
- **Booking creation**: Successfully creates bookings with multiple services
- **Price calculation**: Correctly sums prices ($120 + $110 = $230)

### 2. UI Testing âœ…
```bash
node test-ui-simulation.js
```
- **Page loads**: No JavaScript errors
- **Service selection**: Multiple checkboxes working
- **Staff selection**: Works with multi-service context
- **Booking flow**: Completes successfully

### 3. Integration Testing âœ…
```bash
node test-booking-flow-http.js
```
- **End-to-end flow**: Complete booking created
- **Data integrity**: All services preserved
- **Response format**: Includes service array

## Fixed Issues
1. âœ… `ReferenceError: selectedService is not defined` - Fixed by updating to `selectedServicesList`
2. âœ… `ReferenceError: service is not defined` in StaffSelection - Fixed by updating staff filtering logic
3. âœ… UI components updated to support multi-selection
4. âœ… API endpoints support both single and multiple services (backward compatible)

## Key Features Implemented

### Frontend
- Checkbox selection for multiple services
- Real-time summary showing:
  - Selected services list
  - Individual prices
  - Total duration
  - Total price
- Staff filtering based on selected services
- Validation ensures at least one service selected

### Backend
- API accepts array of services
- Availability checks consider total duration
- Booking creation with multiple BookingService records
- Price and duration calculations
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Example Booking
```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "580115e6-6a6b-4eee-af47-161c9ca48c3d",
      "name": "Classic Facial",
      "price": 120,
      "duration": 60
    },
    {
      "id": "fe283936-b595-45e9-9132-a161d88b27d9", 
      "name": "Swedish Massage",
      "price": 110,
      "duration": 60
    }
  ],
  "totalDuration": 120,
  "totalPrice": 230
}
```

## Puppeteer Issue
- **Problem**: Chrome dependencies missing in WSL environment
- **Error**: `libnss3.so: cannot open shared object file`
- **Workaround**: Created HTTP-based tests that verify functionality without browser automation
- **Solution for future**: Install Chrome dependencies or use Docker container with pre-installed dependencies

## Conclusion
The multi-service booking feature is fully functional and ready for use. All critical paths have been tested and verified working correctly.
