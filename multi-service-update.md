# Multi-Service Booking Update - Root Cause Analysis

## Issue Summary
Multi-service booking updates were failing with "Service not found" errors when updating bookings through the frontend.

## Root Cause
The frontend was sending **fake/placeholder service IDs** instead of real database IDs when updating bookings with multiple services.

### Evidence
1. Frontend was sending: `6b7e8a9c-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678` (fake UUID)
2. Actual Zen Wellness service IDs are like: `7aee7d0f-1272-4978-bc3b-974696a10537`
3. API error: "Service not found: 6b7e8a9c-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678"

## Backend Status: ✅ WORKING
The backend multi-service update functionality is **fully operational**:

1. **Controller** (`bookings.v2.controller.ts`): 
   - Correctly receives and logs services array
   - Passes services to BookingUpdateService

2. **Service** (`booking-update.service.ts`):
   - Deletes existing BookingService records
   - Creates new BookingService records for each service
   - Updates totalAmount correctly
   - All within a transaction for data integrity

3. **Database**:
   - BookingService join table properly stores multiple services
   - Confirmed working when real service IDs are provided

## Test Results
When using real Zen Wellness service IDs:
- ✅ Successfully updated booking RVJ008 from 1 service to 2 services
- ✅ Database correctly shows both services
- ✅ API returns updated booking with all services

## Frontend Issue
The problem is in the frontend service selection component:
- When selecting services for multi-service bookings, the UI is not using real service IDs
- Instead, it's generating or using placeholder UUIDs
- This likely happens in the service selection dialog or dropdown

## Solution Required
Fix the frontend component that handles multi-service selection to:
1. Use actual service IDs from the database
2. Properly map selected services to their database records
3. Send the correct service IDs in the update payload

## How to Test
```bash
# Use the test script with real IDs:
/tmp/update-with-real-ids.sh

# Or manually update with curl using real service IDs
```

## Next Steps
1. Locate the frontend component handling multi-service selection
2. Fix the service ID mapping issue
3. Ensure selected services use their actual database IDs
4. Test the complete flow from UI to database
