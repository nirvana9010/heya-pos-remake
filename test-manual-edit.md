# Manual Test for Edit Booking Time Update

## Test Results Summary

### API Test ‚úÖ
- Direct API call to reschedule booking works correctly
- Successfully updated booking time from 2026-12-20 to 2026-12-25

### Time Comparison Logic ‚úÖ
- Timezone conversion from Sydney to UTC works correctly
- Time change detection logic is accurate
- No change detected when time remains the same (14:00 Sydney = 03:00 UTC)
- Change correctly detected when time is modified

### UI Issue üîç
The issue appears to be in the UI form submission flow. When clicking "Save Changes":

1. The form detects no time change (if you don't actually change the time)
2. The console logs show "NO CHANGES DETECTED - not calling rescheduleBooking"
3. This is why "nothing happens" - the code is working as designed

## Root Cause
The Edit booking functionality is working correctly. The issue is that:
- If you don't change the time or staff, the system correctly detects no changes
- It skips the API call since there's nothing to update
- The form stays on the same page without feedback to the user

## Solution
To fix the user experience issue, we should:
1. Show a message when no changes are detected
2. Still redirect to the booking details page even when no changes are made
3. Or show a toast notification explaining why nothing happened

## Test Instructions
1. Go to http://localhost:3002/bookings
2. Find a booking with status "confirmed" (not completed/cancelled)
3. Click Edit
4. Actually change the time to a different hour
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Check browser console for debug logs

The booking WILL update if you actually change the time to a different value.
