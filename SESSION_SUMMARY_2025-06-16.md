# Session Summary - June 16, 2025

## Main Issue Resolved
**Calendar not showing bookings** - User reported this 3+ times with high frustration. Bookings were visible in the Bookings tab but completely missing from Calendar view.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Calendar time slot bug** - Time slots had missing `hour` and `minute` properties
2. **Date comparison bug** - Using `slot.time.getHours()` when dates didn't match
3. **V2 API missing field** - `staffId` wasn't included, causing all bookings to be filtered out

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend (Calendar)
- Fixed `generateTimeSlots` to include `hour` and `minute` properties
- Updated all time comparisons to use `slot.hour` instead of `slot.time.getHours()`
- Removed temporary debug code that was showing all bookings at midnight

### Backend (V2 API)
- Added `staffId: booking.provider.id` to V2 bookings response
- Updated `BookingListItem` interface to include `staffId`
- Fixed other V2 endpoint issues (displayOrder â†’ sortOrder)

### API Client
- Confirmed proper V2 routing for bookings endpoints
- V1 still used for auth (correct approach)

## Outstanding Issues
1. **Timezone handling** - Bookings may appear on wrong date due to UTC/local conversion
2. **V1 vs V2 confusion** - Auth uses V1, bookings use V2 (this is intentional but confusing)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Bookings appear in calendar at correct times
- [ ] Calendar date navigation works properly
- [ ] Staff filtering shows/hides appropriate bookings
- [ ] No bookings bunched at midnight
- [ ] Timezone displays correctly for user's location

## Files to Review
- `/apps/merchant-app/src/app/calendar/CalendarPageContent.tsx` - Main calendar component
- `/apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/queries/handlers/get-bookings-list.handler.ts` - V2 API handler
- `/docs/CALENDAR_BOOKING_DISPLAY_FIX.md` - Detailed fix documentation
- `/docs/AI_SESSION_MEMORY.md` - Updated with new learnings

## Next Session Priorities
1. Verify calendar displays bookings correctly in production
2. Address any timezone issues if dates are off
3. Continue V2 migration for remaining endpoints
4. Clean up debug logging once confirmed working

## Key Learning
When a user reports the same issue multiple times, STOP making assumptions and dig deeper. Use systematic debugging and leverage tools like mcp__zen__thinkdeep for complex analysis.
