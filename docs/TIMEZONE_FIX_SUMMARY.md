# Timezone Implementation Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The booking response was showing time in 12-hour format (02:00 PM displayed as 02:00) instead of 24-hour format (14:00).

## Root Cause
In `TimezoneUtils.formatInTimezone()`, the time format was set to `hour12: true` which caused:
- 14:00 (2 PM) to be formatted as "02:00 pm"
- When substring(0, 5) was applied, it became "02:00"

## Solution
Changed `hour12: true` to `hour12: false` in timezone.ts:
```typescript
// Before
return dateObj.toLocaleTimeString('en-AU', { 
  timeZone: timezone, 
  hour: '2-digit', 
  minute: '2-digit',
  hour12: true 
});

// After
return dateObj.toLocaleTimeString('en-AU', { 
  timeZone: timezone, 
  hour: '2-digit', 
  minute: '2-digit',
  hour12: false 
});
```

## Test Results
âœ… All timezone tests now pass:
- Time format: 14:00 request returns 14:00 response
- Timezone display: Correct business hours
- DST transitions: Handled properly
- Multi-timezone: Calculations accurate

## What's Working Now

### 1. Booking Creation
- Request time matches response time
- 24-hour format throughout
- Correct timezone handling

### 2. Availability Display
- Slots show in merchant's timezone
- No "24:00" issues
- Business hours respected

### 3. Multi-Timezone Support
- Each location uses its configured timezone
- Not hardcoded to Sydney
- Supports all IANA timezones

## Files Changed
1. `/apps/api/src/utils/shared/timezone.ts` - Fixed time formatting
2. `/apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/booking-availability.service.ts` - Removed hardcoded default

## Verification Steps
1. Run `node scripts/test-timezone-comprehensive.js` - All pass
2. Create booking at 14:00 - Returns 14:00
3. Check different timezones - Each works independently

## Next Steps for Production
1. Test with actual timezone changes via Settings
2. Verify email confirmations include timezone
3. Check merchant dashboard displays
4. Monitor for any 12/24 hour confusion

The timezone system is now fully functional and ready for multi-location merchants across Australia and beyond!
