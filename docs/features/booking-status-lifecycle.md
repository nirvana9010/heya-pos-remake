# Feature: Booking State Management

**Date Implemented**: Original system (various dates)  
**Implemented By**: Original developers + Claude Code Session  
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Related Ticket/Issue**: Booking cancellation UI not updating, notifications not appearing

## üìã Quick Reference

**What It Does**: Manages booking lifecycle states (confirmed ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed/cancelled)  
**Where To Find It**: `apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/` (backend), `apps/merchant-app/src/components/` (frontend)  
**How To Test It**: Manual testing through UI or API endpoints  
**Key Dependencies**: Prisma ORM, React Query, OutboxEvent system, Cache system

## üéØ Business Context

### Why This Feature Exists
Bookings need to progress through different states to track customer appointments from creation to completion. This enables staff to manage their daily schedule and track revenue.

### User Story
As a merchant, I want to see real-time booking status updates so that I can manage my appointments efficiently.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Booking status changes reflect immediately in UI
- [ ] Staff can track daily appointment progress
- [ ] Notifications appear for important booking events

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decision
The system uses:
- Domain-driven design with BookingStatus value object
- Event sourcing via OutboxEvent for notifications
- Redis caching for performance
- React Query for frontend state management

### Files Modified/Created
```
KEY FILES:
Backend:
- apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/domain/value-objects/booking-status.vo.ts - Status enum definition
- apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/domain/entities/booking.entity.ts - State transition logic
- apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/booking-update.service.ts - Service methods
- apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/infrastructure/controllers/bookings.v2.controller.ts - API endpoints

Frontend:
- apps/merchant-app/src/app/(dashboard)/calendar/calendar-enhanced.tsx - Calendar display
- apps/merchant-app/src/components/BookingDetailsSlideOut.tsx - Detail view
- apps/merchant-app/src/lib/clients/bookings-client.ts - API client
```

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Booking status is stored as ENUM in PostgreSQL
CREATE TYPE "BookingStatus" AS ENUM (
  'PENDING',
  'CONFIRMED', 
  'IN_PROGRESS',
  'COMPLETED',
  'CANCELLED',
  'NO_SHOW'
);

-- Booking table uses this enum
ALTER TABLE "Booking" ADD COLUMN "status" "BookingStatus" NOT NULL DEFAULT 'CONFIRMED';
```

### API Changes
```typescript
// Status update endpoints
PATCH /api/v2/bookings/:id/start
  Response: { ...booking, status: "IN_PROGRESS" }
  
PATCH /api/v2/bookings/:id/complete  
  Response: { ...booking, status: "COMPLETED" }
  
PATCH /api/v2/bookings/:id/cancel
  Request: { reason: string }
  Response: { ...booking, status: "CANCELLED" }
  Breaking change: NO
```

### Key Components/Functions
```typescript
// Backend BookingUpdateService methods
cancelBooking(data: CancelBookingData)
  Location: booking-update.service.ts
  Purpose: Cancels booking and creates OutboxEvent
  Used by: BookingsV2Controller
  
// Frontend updateBookingStatus  
updateBookingStatus(bookingId: string, newStatus: string)
  Location: calendar-enhanced.tsx
  Purpose: Calls API and updates local state
  Used by: Calendar UI
```

## üîó Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- [ ] Redis Cache - Stores booking lists for performance
- [ ] OutboxEvent system - Publishes domain events
- [ ] Notification system - Creates merchant/customer notifications

### Downstream Impact
- [ ] Calendar UI - Must refresh to show status changes
- [ ] Notifications - Created from OutboxEvents
- [ ] Analytics - Tracks booking completion rates

### Critical Paths
1. User clicks "Cancel" ‚Üí API called ‚Üí Database updated ‚Üí Cache cleared ‚Üí Event created ‚Üí UI refreshes
2. OutboxPublisher polls ‚Üí Finds events ‚Üí Publishes to EventEmitter ‚Üí Handlers create notifications

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new booking - verify status is "confirmed"
- [ ] Click "Start" - verify status changes to "in-progress"
- [ ] Click "Complete" - verify status changes to "completed"  
- [ ] Click "Cancel" - verify status changes to "cancelled"
- [ ] Refresh page - verify status persists
- [ ] Check notifications bell - verify notification appears (may take 5-10 seconds)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Gotchas

### Handled Edge Cases
- ‚úÖ Cannot cancel already cancelled booking - Returns 400 error
- ‚úÖ Status transitions are validated - Can't go from completed to in-progress

### Known Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cache invalidation missing for cancel** - BookingUpdateService.cancelBooking() doesn't clear cache
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notification delay** - OutboxPublisher polls every 5 seconds, notifications not instant
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend overwrites status** - calendar-enhanced.tsx line 235 overwrites API response with local status

### Performance Notes
- Cache TTL is aggressive to improve performance but causes stale data issues
- OutboxEvent processing is async and can be delayed under load

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Cancelled booking still shows as "confirmed" in UI
- Check: Browser Network tab - is the API returning the old status?
- Check: Is cache being cleared after cancellation?
- Fix: Add cache invalidation to cancelBooking method

**Issue**: Notifications don't appear immediately  
- Check: Are OutboxEvents being created? Check database
- Check: Is OutboxPublisher running? Check pm2 logs
- Check: Is refreshNotifications() being called too early (before event processed)?
- Fix: Increase delay or implement proper WebSocket/SSE

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if OutboxEvents are created
node -e "const {PrismaClient} = require('@prisma/client'); const p = new PrismaClient(); p.outboxEvent.findMany({where:{eventType:'cancelled'},take:5}).then(console.log)"

# Check API logs for errors
pm2 logs api --lines 100 | grep -E "cancelBooking|OutboxPublisher"

# Check if notifications exist in database
node -e "const {PrismaClient} = require('@prisma/client'); const p = new PrismaClient(); p.merchantNotification.findMany({orderBy:{createdAt:'desc'},take:5}).then(console.log)"
```

### Key Log Entries
```
[BookingUpdateService] Starting cancelBooking
[BookingUpdateService] Booking cancelled in DB
[OutboxPublisher] Publishing event: booking.cancelled
[NotificationEventHandler] Handling booking cancelled event
```

## üîÑ Maintenance Notes

### Safe to Modify
- ‚úÖ Notification delay timing
- ‚úÖ UI status badge colors and icons

### Modify with Caution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Status transition logic in Booking entity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache invalidation patterns

### Do NOT Modify Without Full Understanding
- ‚ùå BookingStatus enum values (database migration required)
- ‚ùå OutboxEvent structure (affects all event handlers)

## üìä Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Cache hit/miss ratio - High miss rate indicates cache issues
- OutboxEvent processing delay - Should be < 10 seconds
- Failed status transitions - Indicates business logic violations

### Alerts to Configure
- OutboxEvent backlog > 100 - Publisher may be stuck
- Cache invalidation failures - Will cause stale data

## üìù Additional Notes

### Current Bugs (as of 2025-07-01)

1. **Cancel doesn't update UI**: `cancelBooking` in BookingUpdateService doesn't invalidate cache, causing API to return stale data

2. **Frontend overwrites status**: Line 235 in calendar-enhanced.tsx should not override status:
   ```typescript
   // WRONG
   b.id === bookingId ? { ...b, ...updatedBooking, status: newStatus as any } : b
   
   // CORRECT  
   b.id === bookingId ? { ...b, ...updatedBooking } : b
   ```

3. **Notification refresh timing**: 1-2 second delay is too short for OutboxEvent processing (5 second poll interval)

### Recommended Fixes

1. Add cache invalidation to cancelBooking method
2. Remove status override in frontend
3. Implement WebSocket/SSE for real-time notifications instead of polling
