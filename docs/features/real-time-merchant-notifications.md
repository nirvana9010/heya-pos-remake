# Feature: Merchant Notifications System

**Date Implemented**: 2025-01-01  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-09  
**Implemented By**: Claude Code Session  
**Risk Level**: HIGH (due to unresolved reliability issues)  
**Related Ticket/Issue**: #notifications-implementation

## üìã Quick Reference

**What It Does**: Provides real-time notifications to merchants about booking events with in-app alerts, browser notifications, and sound alerts  
**Where To Find It**: `apps/api/src/notifications` and `apps/merchant-app/src/contexts/notifications-context.tsx`  
**How To Test It**: Manual testing - create/cancel/modify bookings and observe notifications  
**Key Dependencies**: NestJS EventEmitter, React Query, Browser Notifications API

## üéØ Business Context

### Why This Feature Exists
Merchants need immediate awareness of booking activity to manage their business effectively. Without real-time notifications, merchants must constantly refresh their dashboard to see new bookings, leading to delayed responses and poor customer experience.

### User Story
As a merchant, I want to receive instant notifications about booking activities so that I can respond quickly to customer needs and manage my schedule effectively.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Merchants respond to new bookings within 5 minutes on average
- [ ] Reduced customer complaints about slow merchant responses
- [ ] Increased merchant engagement with the platform throughout the day

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decision
Implemented a polling-based architecture (5-second intervals) instead of WebSockets for simplicity and reliability. Uses event-driven architecture on the backend with an outbox pattern for guaranteed delivery.

## üîó Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- [ ] Booking Services - Events trigger notification creation
- [ ] Outbox Publisher - Ensures reliable event delivery
- [ ] Browser Notifications API - For desktop notifications
- [ ] Audio API - For sound notifications

### Downstream Impact
- [ ] Merchant Dashboard - Shows notification badges and lists
- [ ] Calendar View - May trigger notifications on booking changes
- [ ] Booking Details - Links from notification action URLs

### Critical Paths
1. New booking created ‚Üí Event published ‚Üí Notification created ‚Üí Frontend polls ‚Üí Shows notification
2. User clicks browser notification ‚Üí Window focuses ‚Üí Navigates to booking details
3. Merchant marks notification as read ‚Üí Updates UI state ‚Üí Persists to database

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Currently no automated tests - manual testing required
# TODO: Add unit tests for notification services
# TODO: Add integration tests for event handling
# TODO: Add E2E tests for notification flow
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new booking from merchant app - verify "New Booking" notification appears within 5 seconds
- [ ] Create a new booking from public booking app - verify "New Booking" notification appears within 5 seconds
- [ ] Cancel a booking - verify "Booking Cancelled" urgent notification appears
- [ ] Modify a booking - verify "Booking Modified" notification appears
- [ ] Complete a booking - verify "Booking Completed" notification appears
- [ ] Test browser notification permission flow
- [ ] Verify notification sound plays (volume at 30%)
- [ ] Click browser notification - verify navigation to correct booking
- [ ] Mark individual notification as read
- [ ] Mark all notifications as read
- [ ] Test with multiple browser tabs open
- [ ] Test notification persistence after page reload
- [ ] **NOTE**: All notifications currently require clicking bell icon or page refresh to appear

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Gotchas

### Handled Edge Cases
- ‚úÖ Duplicate browser notifications - Uses booking ID as tag for deduplication
- ‚úÖ Sound autoplay restrictions - Errors caught silently
- ‚úÖ Browser notification permissions - Graceful degradation if denied
- ‚úÖ Multiple tabs polling - Each tab polls independently
- ‚úÖ Stale data prevention - Aggressive cache invalidation
- ‚úÖ Duplicate database records - Atomic processing prevents multiple event handling
- ‚úÖ localStorage growth - Automatically cleaned up (keeps last 100 IDs)

### Known Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5-second delay - Not real-time, uses polling instead of WebSockets
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance impact - Continuous polling creates backend load
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No notification batching - Each event creates separate notification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No pagination - Frontend fetches up to 50 notifications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Outbox query performance - Improved with index but still needs monitoring
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Notifications don't appear until page refresh - React Query data updates aren't triggering notification processing

### Performance Notes
- Polling interval: 5 seconds (matches backend outbox polling)
- Cache strategy: No caching (staleTime: 0) to ensure fresh data
- Browser notifications auto-close after 5 seconds
- Sound file should be optimized and cached by browser

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Notifications not appearing until page refresh
- Check: Browser console for `[useNotifications] Fetching notifications...` logs every 5 seconds
- Check: Network tab for polling requests every 5 seconds returning new data
- Check: Console for `[NotificationsContext] Processing notifications` logs
- Check: `pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50` for notification creation
- Root cause: React Query's `dataUpdatedAt` not triggering notification processing despite new data
- Attempted fixes:
  - Added `structuralSharing: false` to force new object references
  - Added effect to watch `dataUpdatedAt` changes
  - Added immediate processing when data updates
  - Problem persists - notifications fetch but don't process until component re-render

**Issue**: Browser notifications not showing
- Check: Browser notification permissions
- Check: Browser settings for site notifications
- Check: localStorage for `shownNotifications` entries
- Fix: Reset permissions and clear localStorage

**Issue**: Sound not playing
- Check: Browser autoplay policies
- Check: `/notification.mp3` file exists in public folder
- Check: Console for audio playback errors
- Fix: User interaction required before first sound

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check API logs for notification events
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50 | grep -i notification

# Check outbox processing
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50 | grep -i outbox

# Monitor slow queries (outbox polling)
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50 | grep "Slow query"
```

### Key Log Entries
```
[NotificationEventHandler] Creating notification for booking
[OutboxPublisher] Publishing X events
[MerchantNotifications] Created notification type: booking_new
```

## üîÑ Maintenance Notes

### Safe to Modify
- ‚úÖ Notification message templates and titles
- ‚úÖ Notification priorities and types
- ‚úÖ Browser notification duration (currently 5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Sound volume (currently 30%)

### Modify with Caution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Polling interval - Affects server load and notification delay
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Event handler logic - Ensure all booking states covered
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache invalidation strategy - May cause data inconsistencies

### Do NOT Modify Without Full Understanding
- ‚ùå Outbox pattern implementation - Critical for reliability
- ‚ùå Event publishing in booking services - May break notification flow
- ‚ùå localStorage notification tracking - Prevents duplicate browser alerts

## üìä Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Notification delivery time - Should be < 10 seconds from event
- Polling request rate - Should match expected merchant count
- Unread notification count - Indicates merchant engagement
- Browser notification permission rate - User adoption metric

### Alerts to Configure
- Outbox table size > 1000 - Indicates processing issues
- Notification creation failures - Critical for merchant awareness
- Polling endpoint response time > 1s - Performance degradation

## üìù Additional Notes

- WebSocket implementation was removed in favor of polling for simplicity
- The 5-second polling interval was chosen to balance responsiveness with server load
- Browser notification behavior varies significantly across browsers and OS
- Future optimization: Consider implementing notification batching for high-volume merchants
- The outbox pattern ensures notifications are never lost, even during service disruptions

### Email/SMS Implementation Status (2025-07-09)
- **Complete Implementation**: All services, templates, and providers are coded
- **Event Integration**: NotificationEventHandler calls email/SMS for all booking events
- **Dependencies Installed**: SendGrid and Twilio packages installed successfully
- **Configuration Required**:
  ```
  SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-key
  SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
  TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-sid
  TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
  TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890  # Must be a real Twilio number
  ```
- **Fixed Issues**: 
  - SendGrid TypeScript import resolved (changed to CommonJS require)
  - Provider factories updated to use proper dependency injection
  - Both services initializing successfully as seen in logs
- **To Activate**: Update Twilio phone number from placeholder to actual Twilio number

### Recent Fixes (2025-01-01)
- Fixed race condition where all notifications were marked as "seen" preventing browser alerts
- Added atomic processing to outbox events to prevent duplicate handling
- Improved notification state tracking - only processed notifications are tracked
- Added debouncing (100ms) to prevent rapid state updates
- Browser notifications now use booking ID as tag for better deduplication
- Added localStorage cleanup to prevent unbounded growth

### Updates (2025-01-03)
- Added missing `booking.rescheduled` event handler in NotificationEventHandler
- Created database index for OutboxEvent queries: `CREATE INDEX "OutboxEvent_processedAt_retryCount_idx"`
- Simplified notification messages to avoid time formatting issues
- Attempted to fix auto-notification by processing on React Query data updates

### Updates (2025-07-03)
- Fixed missing notifications for bookings created through public booking app
  - Added OutboxEvent creation in PublicBookingService
  - Now triggers same notification flow as merchant-created bookings
- Notifications confirmed working from booking app to merchant app
- Auto-popup issue remains unresolved for all notification sources

### Updates (2025-07-09)
- Implemented optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
  - Added optimistic notifications state in NotificationsContext
  - SSE and Supabase handlers now update UI immediately without waiting for API
  - Notifications merge optimistic state with API data to prevent duplicates
- Fixed EventEmitter2 missing in MerchantNotificationsService
  - Backend wasn't emitting events after creating notifications
  - Added EventEmitter2 injection and 'notification.created' event emission
- Added Supabase environment variables to merchant app
- Migration to Supabase Realtime attempted but incomplete:
  - Feature flag system implemented for gradual rollout
  - Supabase client initialization code added
  - SQL migration for Realtime not yet applied to database
  - SSE remains primary notification method

### Critical Unresolved Issues
- **SSE Performance Issues**:
  - SSE notifications are slow (several seconds delay)
  - SSE doesn't force calendar refresh reliably
  - Console shows SSE events received but UI updates are inconsistent
  
- **Supabase Realtime Not Working**:
  - Configuration is in place but Realtime not functioning
  - Missing SQL migration for Realtime subscriptions
  - No console logs showing Supabase connection attempts
  - Feature flag currently disabled by default

- **Calendar Auto-Refresh Issues**:
  - Calendar doesn't update automatically with new bookings
  - Manual refresh required to see new bookings
  - bookingEvents.broadcast() called but calendar hooks not always responding

### Current State Summary
- **Working**: Basic notification creation and display after manual refresh
- **Partially Working**: SSE events received but slow and unreliable UI updates
- **Not Working**: Supabase Realtime, automatic calendar refresh, instant notification popups
- **Email/SMS Status**: 
  - Infrastructure fully implemented (services, templates, providers)
  - SendGrid and Twilio packages installed (2025-07-09)
  - Credentials configured in .env
  - Both Twilio SMS and SendGrid email services initializing successfully
  - SendGrid TypeScript import issue resolved (using CommonJS require)
  - Provider factories updated to use dependency injection
  - Ready for testing but requires updating Twilio phone number from placeholder (+1234567890)
  
### Technical Insights Discovered
1. **OutboxEvent Performance**: Queries were slow (400-500ms) due to missing index on `processedAt` and `retryCount`
2. **Event Handler Coverage**: The system was missing handlers for some booking events (e.g., rescheduled)
3. **React Query Behavior**: Setting `structuralSharing: false` doesn't guarantee effect triggers
4. **Notification Deduplication**: Using booking ID as browser notification tag prevents duplicate popups
5. **PM2 Logging**: Always use `--nostream` flag to avoid hanging when reading logs

### Debugging Shortcuts
```bash
# Quick notification system check
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 20 | grep -E "(notification|Notification|NOTIFICATION)"

# Monitor OutboxEvent processing
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 20 | grep -E "(OutboxPublisher|Slow query)"

# Check if notifications are being created
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 20 | grep "Creating notification for"
```
