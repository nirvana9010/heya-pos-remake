# Feature: Online Customer Bookings System

**Date Implemented**: 2024-12-01 (estimated)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-03  
**Implemented By**: Development Team  
**Risk Level**: HIGH (merchant isolation bug, race conditions)  
**Related Ticket/Issue**: #online-bookings

## üìã Quick Reference

**What It Does**: Enables customers to book services online through a public-facing booking app with real-time availability checking  
**Where To Find It**: `apps/booking-app` (frontend) and `apps/api/src/public` (backend endpoints)  
**How To Test It**: Navigate to http://localhost:3001 and complete a booking flow  
**Key Dependencies**: Next.js, React Query, Prisma, PostgreSQL with pessimistic locking

## üéØ Business Context

### Why This Feature Exists
Customers expect to book services online 24/7 without calling during business hours. This self-service booking system reduces administrative burden on merchants while increasing booking conversions and customer satisfaction.

### User Story
As a customer, I want to book beauty services online at my convenience, see real-time availability, and receive instant confirmation so I can plan my schedule without phone calls or waiting.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 60% of bookings come through online channel
- [ ] Less than 1% booking failure rate due to conflicts
- [ ] Average booking completion time under 3 minutes
- [ ] Zero merchant data leakage between tenants

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decision
- **Multi-tenant architecture** using subdomain-based merchant isolation
- **Pessimistic locking** in database transactions to prevent double bookings
- **No temporary slot reservation** - availability checked at booking time only
- **Polling-based availability** updates rather than real-time WebSockets

### Files Modified/Created
```
CREATED:
- apps/booking-app/* - Complete Next.js customer booking application
- apps/api/src/public/public-booking.controller.ts - Public booking endpoints
- apps/api/src/public/availability.controller.ts - Availability checking endpoint
- apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/public-booking.service.ts - Business logic
- apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/booking-availability.service.ts - Slot calculation

CRITICAL BUGS FIXED (2025-01-03):
- apps/api/src/public/availability.controller.ts
  - Fixed: Was using findFirst() to get ANY merchant instead of requested one
  - Impact: Showed time slots from wrong merchant (Ngan Nails instead of Hamilton)
  
- apps/api/src/public/public-booking.controller.ts
  - Fixed: service-categories endpoint had same findFirst() bug
  - Impact: Could show services from wrong merchant
```

### Database Schema
```typescript
// No new tables - uses existing schema
Booking {
  id: string
  merchantId: string  // Critical for multi-tenant isolation
  customerId: string
  providerId: string  // Staff member
  startTime: DateTime
  endTime: DateTime
  status: BookingStatus
  // ... other fields
}

// Pessimistic locking during creation:
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Lock the staff member
  const staff = await tx.staff.findUnique({
    where: { id: staffId },
    // This creates a SELECT ... FOR UPDATE lock
  });
  
  // Check for conflicts
  const conflicts = await tx.booking.findMany({
    where: { /* overlap conditions */ }
  });
  
  if (conflicts.length > 0) {
    throw new ConflictException('Time slot no longer available');
  }
  
  // Create booking
  return await tx.booking.create({ /* ... */ });
});
```

### Key Components/Functions
```typescript
// Backend Services
PublicBookingService
  Location: apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/public-booking.service.ts
  Purpose: Handles public booking creation with conflict detection
  Critical Method: createPublicBooking() - has transaction with pessimistic locking

BookingAvailabilityService  
  Location: apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/booking-availability.service.ts
  Purpose: Calculates available time slots based on staff schedule and existing bookings
  Critical Method: getAvailableSlots() - filters by merchant, staff, and service

// Frontend Components

  Location: apps/booking-app/src/app/[merchant]/booking/BookingPageClient.tsx
  Purpose: Main booking flow wizard (7 steps)
  Key State: selectedServices, selectedStaff, selectedDate, selectedTime

DateTimeSelection
  Location: apps/booking-app/src/components/booking/DateTimeSelection.tsx
  Purpose: Calendar and time slot picker
  Features: Groups slots by Morning/Afternoon/Evening, shows availability

useApiClient Hook

```

## üîó Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- [ ] Merchant configuration - determines booking rules and constraints
- [ ] Staff schedules - defines when bookings can be made
- [ ] Service definitions - duration and pricing information
- [ ] Customer records - created on-demand during booking

### Downstream Impact
- [ ] Merchant notifications - triggered on new bookings
- [ ] Calendar views - shows booked appointments
- [ ] Payment processing - if deposits required
- [ ] Email confirmations - sent to customers

### Critical Paths
1. Customer selects service ‚Üí Checks availability ‚Üí Shows time slots ‚Üí Creates booking
2. Booking creation ‚Üí Locks staff member ‚Üí Validates no conflicts ‚Üí Saves to database
3. Merchant subdomain ‚Üí Determines data isolation ‚Üí Prevents cross-tenant data access

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Access booking app with merchant subdomain (e.g., http://localhost:3001/hamilton)
- [ ] Verify only Hamilton services and staff appear
- [ ] Select a service and pick available time slot
- [ ] Complete booking with test customer info
- [ ] Attempt to book same slot again - should fail with "no longer available"
- [ ] Check different merchant (e.g., /ngan-nails) shows different services
- [ ] Test booking without selecting staff (if merchant allows unassigned)
- [ ] Verify booking appears in merchant dashboard

### Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test booking creation
SUBDOMAIN="hamilton"
SERVICE_ID="580115e6-6a6b-4eee-af47-161c9ca48c3d"  # Classic Facial
STAFF_ID="27597e20-198b-41a7-8411-651361d8308a"     # Emma Williams

curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/public/bookings?subdomain=$SUBDOMAIN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-merchant-subdomain: $SUBDOMAIN" \
  -d '{
    "customerName": "Test Customer",
    "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
    "customerPhone": "+61 400 000 000",
    "serviceId": "'$SERVICE_ID'",
    "staffId": "'$STAFF_ID'",
    "date": "2025-01-04",
    "startTime": "09:00",
    "notes": "Test booking"
  }'
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Gotchas

### Handled Edge Cases
- ‚úÖ Double booking prevention - pessimistic locking in transaction
- ‚úÖ Customer creation - automatically creates if doesn't exist
- ‚úÖ Timezone handling - converts between UTC and location timezone
- ‚úÖ Multi-service bookings - supports booking multiple services at once
- ‚úÖ Unassigned bookings - if merchant allows, can book without selecting staff

### Known Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No slot reservation** - selected slot can be taken before payment completes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No re-validation** - doesn't check availability again before final submission
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Merchant isolation bug** (FIXED 2025-01-03) - was showing wrong merchant's slots
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No booking modification** - customers can't reschedule online
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No cancellation** - customers can't cancel online

### Race Condition Scenario
1. Customer A selects 9:00 AM slot
2. Customer B selects same 9:00 AM slot  
3. Customer B completes booking first
4. Customer A completes payment
5. Customer A gets "time slot no longer available" error
6. Customer A is frustrated after going through entire flow

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Time slot is no longer available" error at checkout
- Check: Someone else booked the slot between selection and submission
- Check: Merchant subdomain mismatch (pre-2025-01-03 bug)
- Check: Service belongs to different merchant
- Fix: Ensure using correct merchant subdomain in all API calls

**Issue**: Wrong merchant's services/slots appearing
- Check: `/api/v1/public/availability` endpoint using findFirst()
- Check: `/api/v1/public/service-categories` endpoint using findFirst()
- Fix: Both fixed on 2025-01-03 to use merchant subdomain

**Issue**: No time slots showing
- Check: Staff working hours configured
- Check: Service duration fits in available time
- Check: Not searching too far in future (90 day limit)
- Check: Merchant subdomain header present

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check which merchant services belong to
node -e "
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
prisma.service.findUnique({
  where: { id: 'SERVICE_ID' },
  include: { merchant: true }
}).then(s => console.log(s?.merchant?.subdomain));
"

# Test availability endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/public/availability?\
serviceId=SERVICE_ID&staffId=STAFF_ID&\
startDate=2025-01-04&endDate=2025-01-05&\
timezone=Australia/Sydney" \
-H "x-merchant-subdomain: hamilton"

# Check for booking conflicts
SELECT * FROM "Booking" 
WHERE "providerId" = 'STAFF_ID'
AND "status" NOT IN ('CANCELLED', 'NO_SHOW')
AND "startTime" < '2025-01-04 10:00:00'
AND "endTime" > '2025-01-04 09:00:00';
```

## üîÑ Maintenance Notes

### Safe to Modify
- ‚úÖ Time slot grouping (Morning/Afternoon/Evening boundaries)
- ‚úÖ UI styling and layout
- ‚úÖ Validation messages
- ‚úÖ Available time slot intervals (15, 30, 60 minutes)

### Modify with Caution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Merchant subdomain detection logic - affects data isolation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflict detection query - must catch all overlapping bookings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction isolation - could cause deadlocks if changed

### Do NOT Modify Without Full Understanding
- ‚ùå Pessimistic locking strategy - prevents double bookings
- ‚ùå Multi-tenant query filters - prevents data leakage
- ‚ùå Database transaction boundaries - ensures data consistency

## üìä Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Booking success rate - should be > 99%
- Time slot conflict rate - indicates race condition frequency
- Average booking completion time - user experience metric
- Merchant isolation violations - CRITICAL security metric

### Alerts to Configure
- Booking failure rate > 2% - indicates system issue
- Cross-tenant data access attempts - security breach
- Availability endpoint errors - affects customer experience
- Transaction deadlocks - indicates locking issue

## üîß Recommended Improvements

### High Priority
1. **Add slot reservation system** - Hold slot for 10 minutes during checkout
2. **Re-validate before payment** - Check availability one more time
3. **Add booking modification** - Let customers reschedule online
4. **Add cancellation** - Let customers cancel with policy enforcement

### Medium Priority
1. **WebSocket availability updates** - Real-time slot updates
2. **Waitlist functionality** - Notify when slot becomes available
3. **Recurring bookings** - Book same time weekly/monthly
4. **Group bookings** - Multiple people, same time

### Low Priority
1. **Smart time suggestions** - ML-based optimal timing
2. **Dynamic pricing** - Peak/off-peak rates
3. **Package deals** - Multiple services discount
4. **Loyalty program** - Integration with rewards

## üìù Additional Notes

- The merchant isolation bug was critical - could have exposed customer data across businesses
- Pessimistic locking adds small performance overhead but prevents major issues
- Consider implementing optimistic UI updates with rollback for better UX
- The 90-day availability limit prevents database overload from malicious queries
- All times are stored in UTC and converted to location timezone for display
