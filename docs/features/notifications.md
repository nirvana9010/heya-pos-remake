# Feature: Merchant Notifications System

**Date Implemented**: 2025-01-01  
**Implemented By**: Claude Code Session  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Related Ticket/Issue**: #notifications-implementation

## üìã Quick Reference

**What It Does**: Provides real-time notifications to merchants about booking events with in-app alerts, browser notifications, and sound alerts  
**Where To Find It**: `apps/api/src/notifications` and `apps/merchant-app/src/contexts/notifications-context.tsx`  
**How To Test It**: Manual testing - create/cancel/modify bookings and observe notifications  
**Key Dependencies**: NestJS EventEmitter, React Query, Browser Notifications API

## üéØ Business Context

### Why This Feature Exists
Merchants need immediate awareness of booking activity to manage their business effectively. Without real-time notifications, merchants must constantly refresh their dashboard to see new bookings, leading to delayed responses and poor customer experience.

### User Story
As a merchant, I want to receive instant notifications about booking activities so that I can respond quickly to customer needs and manage my schedule effectively.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Merchants respond to new bookings within 5 minutes on average
- [ ] Reduced customer complaints about slow merchant responses
- [ ] Increased merchant engagement with the platform throughout the day

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decision
Implemented a polling-based architecture (5-second intervals) instead of WebSockets for simplicity and reliability. Uses event-driven architecture on the backend with an outbox pattern for guaranteed delivery.

## üîó Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- [ ] Booking Services - Events trigger notification creation
- [ ] Outbox Publisher - Ensures reliable event delivery
- [ ] Browser Notifications API - For desktop notifications
- [ ] Audio API - For sound notifications

### Downstream Impact
- [ ] Merchant Dashboard - Shows notification badges and lists
- [ ] Calendar View - May trigger notifications on booking changes
- [ ] Booking Details - Links from notification action URLs

### Critical Paths
1. New booking created ‚Üí Event published ‚Üí Notification created ‚Üí Frontend polls ‚Üí Shows notification
2. User clicks browser notification ‚Üí Window focuses ‚Üí Navigates to booking details
3. Merchant marks notification as read ‚Üí Updates UI state ‚Üí Persists to database

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Currently no automated tests - manual testing required
# TODO: Add unit tests for notification services
# TODO: Add integration tests for event handling
# TODO: Add E2E tests for notification flow
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new booking - verify "New Booking" notification appears within 5 seconds
- [ ] Cancel a booking - verify "Booking Cancelled" urgent notification appears
- [ ] Modify a booking - verify "Booking Modified" notification appears
- [ ] Complete a booking - verify "Booking Completed" notification appears
- [ ] Test browser notification permission flow
- [ ] Verify notification sound plays (volume at 30%)
- [ ] Click browser notification - verify navigation to correct booking
- [ ] Mark individual notification as read
- [ ] Mark all notifications as read
- [ ] Test with multiple browser tabs open
- [ ] Test notification persistence after page reload

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Gotchas

### Handled Edge Cases
- ‚úÖ Duplicate browser notifications - Uses booking ID as tag for deduplication
- ‚úÖ Sound autoplay restrictions - Errors caught silently
- ‚úÖ Browser notification permissions - Graceful degradation if denied
- ‚úÖ Multiple tabs polling - Each tab polls independently
- ‚úÖ Stale data prevention - Aggressive cache invalidation
- ‚úÖ Duplicate database records - Atomic processing prevents multiple event handling
- ‚úÖ localStorage growth - Automatically cleaned up (keeps last 100 IDs)

### Known Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5-second delay - Not real-time, uses polling instead of WebSockets
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance impact - Continuous polling creates backend load
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No notification batching - Each event creates separate notification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No pagination - Frontend fetches up to 50 notifications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Outbox query performance - May need optimization (see CLAUDE.md)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Timing inconsistency - Notifications may take 5 seconds to 4+ minutes due to various factors

### Performance Notes
- Polling interval: 5 seconds (matches backend outbox polling)
- Cache strategy: No caching (staleTime: 0) to ensure fresh data
- Browser notifications auto-close after 5 seconds
- Sound file should be optimized and cached by browser

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Notifications not appearing or delayed (1-4+ minutes)
- Check: Browser console for errors and notification debug logs
- Check: Network tab for polling requests every 5 seconds
- Check: `pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50` for backend errors
- Check: Frontend logs for `isNew: false` - indicates race condition
- Fix: Clear localStorage `shownBrowserNotifications` and refresh page
- Fix: Run `node clear-notification-cache.js` to clean up duplicates
- Root cause: Race condition in notification state tracking (partially fixed)

**Issue**: Browser notifications not showing
- Check: Browser notification permissions
- Check: Browser settings for site notifications
- Check: localStorage for `shownNotifications` entries
- Fix: Reset permissions and clear localStorage

**Issue**: Sound not playing
- Check: Browser autoplay policies
- Check: `/notification.mp3` file exists in public folder
- Check: Console for audio playback errors
- Fix: User interaction required before first sound

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check API logs for notification events
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50 | grep -i notification

# Check outbox processing
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50 | grep -i outbox

# Monitor slow queries (outbox polling)
pm2 logs api --nostream --lines 50 | grep "Slow query"
```

### Key Log Entries
```
[NotificationEventHandler] Creating notification for booking
[OutboxPublisher] Publishing X events
[MerchantNotifications] Created notification type: booking_new
```

## üîÑ Maintenance Notes

### Safe to Modify
- ‚úÖ Notification message templates and titles
- ‚úÖ Notification priorities and types
- ‚úÖ Browser notification duration (currently 5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Sound volume (currently 30%)

### Modify with Caution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Polling interval - Affects server load and notification delay
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Event handler logic - Ensure all booking states covered
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache invalidation strategy - May cause data inconsistencies

### Do NOT Modify Without Full Understanding
- ‚ùå Outbox pattern implementation - Critical for reliability
- ‚ùå Event publishing in booking services - May break notification flow
- ‚ùå localStorage notification tracking - Prevents duplicate browser alerts

## üìä Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Notification delivery time - Should be < 10 seconds from event
- Polling request rate - Should match expected merchant count
- Unread notification count - Indicates merchant engagement
- Browser notification permission rate - User adoption metric

### Alerts to Configure
- Outbox table size > 1000 - Indicates processing issues
- Notification creation failures - Critical for merchant awareness
- Polling endpoint response time > 1s - Performance degradation

## üìù Additional Notes

- WebSocket implementation was removed in favor of polling for simplicity
- The 5-second polling interval was chosen to balance responsiveness with server load
- Browser notification behavior varies significantly across browsers and OS
- Future optimization: Consider implementing notification batching for high-volume merchants
- Future enhancement: Add notification preferences (email, SMS, push)
- The outbox pattern ensures notifications are never lost, even during service disruptions

### Recent Fixes (2025-01-01)
- Fixed race condition where all notifications were marked as "seen" preventing browser alerts
- Added atomic processing to outbox events to prevent duplicate handling
- Improved notification state tracking - only processed notifications are tracked
- Added debouncing (100ms) to prevent rapid state updates
- Browser notifications now use booking ID as tag for better deduplication
- Added localStorage cleanup to prevent unbounded growth

### Remaining Issues
- Notification timing is inconsistent (5 seconds to 4+ minutes)
- Root cause appears to be complex interaction between:
  - Frontend polling and state management
  - React Query caching behavior
  - Browser notification API limitations
  - Possible network/database performance variations
- Notifications do eventually appear, but timing is unpredictable
