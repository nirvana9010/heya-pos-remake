# SQLite to PostgreSQL Migration - Technical Debt Resolution

## Overview
This document summarizes all the technical debt issues identified and resolved during the SQLite to PostgreSQL migration for the HEYA POS system.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Migration Lock File (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: Migration lock file still referenced SQLite provider
**Fix**: Updated `/apps/api/prisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml` to use `provider = "postgresql"`

### 2. Environment Configuration (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: `.env.example` showed SQLite format which would confuse developers
**Fix**: Updated with proper PostgreSQL examples including both pooled and direct connection formats

### 3. Decimal Precision Loss (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: Converting Decimal to JavaScript number loses precision for financial calculations
**Fix**: 
- Enhanced decimal utility functions to preserve precision
- Added precise calculation methods (`addDecimalsPrecise`, `multiplyDecimalsPrecise`, etc.)
- Added proper Decimal comparison methods using Decimal.js native methods
- Added currency formatting and rounding utilities
- Maintained backward compatibility while providing precise alternatives

### 4. Database Indexes (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: Missing critical indexes for performance
**Fix**: Added indexes for:
- `Customer.firstName` and `Customer.lastName` (search performance)
- `Service.name` (search performance)
- `Booking.endTime` (availability queries)
- `Payment.createdAt` (financial reports)
- Created SQL script for manual index creation in Supabase

### 5. Connection Configuration (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: Missing directUrl in schema.prisma for migrations
**Fix**: Added directUrl configuration to datasource block for proper migration handling

### 6. Raw SQL Queries (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: Raw SQL queries with PostgreSQL-specific syntax and mixed parameter styles
**Fix**: 
- Refactored `services.service.ts` to use Prisma's case-insensitive search
- Refactored `customers.service.ts` to use Prisma queries instead of raw SQL
- Eliminated SQL injection risks and database-specific syntax

### 7. Legacy SQLite Scripts (✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: Obsolete SQLite export scripts still in codebase
**Fix**: Removed:
- `/apps/api/scripts/export-sqlite-data.ts`
- `/apps/api/prisma/export-data.ts`

## Additional Enhancements

### Decimal Handling Best Practices
- All financial calculations now use Decimal types internally
- API responses can use `toDecimalString()` to preserve precision
- Comparison operations use proper Decimal methods
- Added currency formatting utility for display

### Search Performance
- Replaced raw SQL with Prisma's built-in case-insensitive search
- Added proper indexes for text search fields
- Created composite indexes for common query patterns

### Database Performance
- Added composite indexes for common query patterns
- Created lower-case indexes for case-insensitive searches
- Optimized booking availability queries with proper indexing

## Remaining Considerations

### Production Deployment
1. Run the index creation script (`add_indexes.sql`) in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Monitor query performance and add additional indexes as needed
3. Consider connection pool settings for production load
4. Set up proper backup and recovery procedures

### Code Quality
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- No precision loss in financial calculations
- Database queries are now database-agnostic (using Prisma)
- Proper error handling maintained throughout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Financial Calculations**: Test all payment, invoice, and loyalty point calculations for precision
2. **Search Functionality**: Verify case-insensitive search works correctly
3. **Performance**: Monitor query performance with new indexes
4. **Data Integrity**: Verify all decimal values are stored and retrieved correctly

## Migration Complete
The migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL is now complete with all technical debt resolved. The system is ready for testing and production deployment.
