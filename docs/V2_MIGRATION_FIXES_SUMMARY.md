# V2 Migration Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied after the 4-phase migration to V2 bookings with CQRS and Outbox patterns.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Customer Names Showing as "Unknown"**
**Problem**: The V2 API was returning `customerName` as a flat field, but the frontend's `transformBooking` method expected nested `customer.firstName` and `customer.lastName`.

**Solution**: Updated `transformBooking` in `api-client.ts` to handle both V1 (nested) and V2 (flat) response formats:
```typescript
// Now handles both formats:
const customerName = booking.customerName || 
  (booking.customer ? 
    `${booking.customer.firstName} ${booking.customer.lastName}`.trim() : 
    'Unknown Customer');
```

### 2. ❌ **Frontend Still Calling Removed V1 Endpoints**
**Problem**: Several V1 endpoints were removed but frontend was still calling them.

**Solutions Applied**:
- `/v1/bookings/today` → Updated to use `apiClient.getBookings()` with date filtering
- `/v1/dashboard/stats` → Already had fallback logic in apiClient
- `/v1/bookings/:id/status` → Replaced with specific V2 methods

### 3. ❌ **Generic Status Update Replaced with Specific Actions**
**Problem**: V2 removed generic status update in favor of specific actions.

**Solution**: 
- Added methods: `startBooking()`, `completeBooking()`, `cancelBooking()`
- Updated components to use specific methods instead of `updateBookingStatus()`
- Added deprecation warning for backward compatibility

### 4. ✅ **API Version Routing Working**
The automatic version prefixing is working correctly:
- `/bookings/*` routes → `/v2/bookings/*`
- All other routes → `/v1/*`
- Public routes → `/api/v1/public/*`

## Component Updates

### Files Modified:
1. **api-client.ts**
   - Fixed `transformBooking` to handle V1/V2 formats
   - Added V2 specific status methods
   - Version prefix logic already working

2. **BookingsPageContent.tsx**
   - Changed `updateBookingStatus(id, 'IN_PROGRESS')` → `startBooking(id)`

3. **calendar-enhanced.tsx**
   - Updated to use V2 specific status methods
   - Added proper error handling

4. **bookings.v2.controller.ts**
   - Re-enabled `@Permissions('booking.read')` for GET /bookings

## Test Results

All V2 endpoints tested and working:
- ✅ V2 bookings list (`/api/v2/bookings`)
- ✅ V2 single booking (`/api/v2/bookings/:id`)
- ✅ V2 calendar view (`/api/v2/bookings/calendar`)
- ✅ Customer data properly displayed
- ✅ Authentication and permissions working
- ✅ Public endpoints accessible at `/api/v1/public/*`

## What We Learned

1. **Always consider frontend integration** when migrating APIs
2. **Response format changes** need to be handled gracefully
3. **Deprecation patterns** help smooth transitions
4. **Test scripts** are essential for validating migrations

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Dashboard Stats Endpoint**: Currently using frontend fallback. Could implement a proper V2 endpoint if needed.
2. **Multi-tenant Support**: Public endpoints currently use `findFirst({ status: 'ACTIVE' })` - needs proper merchant identification.
3. **Performance**: Consider implementing pagination properly in customer bookings view.

## Migration Approach Summary

The 4-phase migration successfully:
1. ✅ Removed legacy booking module completely
2. ✅ Implemented bounded contexts with transactional scripts
3. ✅ Added Outbox pattern for reliable event delivery
4. ✅ Implemented CQRS for better separation of concerns
5. ✅ Maintained backward compatibility where needed

The system is now running on V2 with proper domain boundaries and event-driven architecture.
