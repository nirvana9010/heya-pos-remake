# Booking Dates Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The user reported only seeing bookings up to May 11, 2025, despite the current date being June 1, 2025. Investigation revealed:

1. **Database contains correct data**: 216 total bookings, including 6 for today (June 1) and 140 future bookings
2. **Default query issue**: The bookings page loads without any date filter, attempting to fetch ALL bookings
3. **Pagination limitation**: API returns only 20 bookings per page by default
4. **No date filtering in UI**: The bookings page lacks date range selection options

## Root Causes

1. **API Default Behavior**: When no date filter is provided, the service now defaults to showing "upcoming" bookings (today and future) to prevent loading all historical data
2. **Frontend Issue**: The merchant app's bookings page doesn't provide date filtering options, making it impossible to navigate to different date ranges
3. **Calendar Page**: Uses mock data instead of real API data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. API Improvements (Backend)

- **Added date filtering options** to bookings endpoint:
  - `date`: Filter for specific date
  - `startDate` & `endDate`: Date range filtering  
  - `includeAll`: Boolean to fetch all bookings (past and future)
  - Default behavior: Show today and future bookings only

- **Created new DTO** (`QueryBookingsDto`) for proper validation
- **Improved date handling** to work correctly with timezones

### 2. Frontend Updates (Merchant App)

- **Added date filter dropdown** to bookings page with options:
  - "Upcoming" (default): Today and future bookings
  - "All Bookings": All bookings regardless of date
  - "Past Only": Historical bookings only

- **Updated API client** to support flexible query parameters
- **Fixed loadBookings** to respect date filter selection

## File Changes

### Backend Files Modified:
- `/apps/api/src/bookings/bookings.service.ts` - Updated findAll method with better date filtering
- `/apps/api/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts` - Added QueryBookingsDto validation
- `/apps/api/src/bookings/dto/query-bookings.dto.ts` - New DTO for query parameters

### Frontend Files Modified:
- `/apps/merchant-app/src/app/bookings/page.tsx` - Added date filter UI and state management
- `/apps/merchant-app/src/lib/api-client.ts` - Updated getBookings to accept flexible parameters

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test/check-booking-dates.ts` - Analyzes booking date distribution
- `test/test-booking-api.ts` - Tests various API query combinations
- `test/test-all-bookings.ts` - Fetches all bookings with pagination

## Next Steps

1. **Calendar Integration**: The calendar page should be updated to use real API data instead of mock data
2. **Date Picker**: Consider adding a date picker component for more precise date filtering
3. **Performance**: Monitor API performance with large datasets
4. **User Preferences**: Consider saving the user's preferred date filter setting

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Select "Upcoming" to see today's and future bookings (default)
2. Select "All Bookings" to see the complete history
3. Select "Past Only" to see only historical bookings
4. Use search and status filters in combination with date filters
