## üö® CRITICAL: Recurring Port/Service Management Problem

### The Problem That Keeps Happening
**Every time services restart, we waste hours debugging "Failed to fetch" errors.** This is NOT a random issue - it's a systemic problem with how we manage services.

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Port Confusion**: API configured for port 3000 but various places expect 3001
2. **Build Cache Corruption**: Next.js `.next` cache corrupts when services crash
3. **Process Zombies**: Multiple `nest start` processes running simultaneously
4. **No Clean Shutdown**: Background processes (`&`) without proper tracking
5. **Missing Health Checks**: No way to quickly verify all services are running

### THE SOLUTION - USE THESE SCRIPTS ALWAYS:
```bash
npm run start       # Start all services properly
npm run stop        # Stop all services cleanly
npm run status      # Check what's running
npm run restart     # Full restart
npm run clean-start # Clean caches and start fresh
```

### Port Assignments (NEVER CHANGE):
- API: 3000
- Booking App: 3001
- Merchant App: 3002
- Admin Dashboard: 3003

### Common Error Fixes:
1. **"Failed to fetch"**: Run `npm run status` then `npm run restart`
2. **"Cannot find module './496.js'"**: Run `npm run clean-start`
3. **"EADDRINUSE"**: Run `npm run stop` then `npm run start`
4. **Multiple processes**: Run `npm run stop` then check with `npm run status`

### DO NOT DO THESE:
- ‚ùå Start services with `npm run dev` in individual directories
- ‚ùå Use random background processes with `&`
- ‚ùå Change port assignments
- ‚ùå Kill processes without using the stop script
- ‚ùå Debug for hours - use the scripts!

## ‚ö° Quick Decision Tree

```
API won't start?
‚îú‚îÄ Check status: `npm run status`
‚îú‚îÄ Try restart: `npm run restart`
‚îú‚îÄ Still failing? ‚Üí Use clean start: `npm run clean-start`
‚îî‚îÄ Still issues? ‚Üí Debug systematically (see below)

Repeated error pattern?
‚îú‚îÄ Same error 3+ times? ‚Üí STOP
‚îú‚îÄ Check this file for solution
‚îú‚îÄ Fix the root cause, don't work around it
‚îî‚îÄ If not here ‚Üí Add it after fixing
```

### Fixing API Issues Properly

**Common API startup problems and their REAL fixes:**

1. **Port conflicts (EADDRINUSE)**
   ```bash
   npm run stop       # Clean shutdown
   npm run status     # Verify stopped
   npm run start      # Clean start
   ```

2. **Module resolution errors**
   ```bash
   # Build packages first - they're dependencies!
   npm run build:packages
   npm run clean-start
   ```

3. **Build cache corruption**
   ```bash
   # Nuclear option - full reset
   cd apps/api
   rm -rf dist node_modules .next
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run start:dev
   ```

4. **Process zombies**
   ```bash
   npm run stop       # Uses proper process tracking
   ps aux | grep nest # Verify cleanup
   npm run start      # Fresh start
   ```

**Key principle**: The API MUST work. Don't bypass it - fix it.

## üö® Critical Rules - DO NOT VIOLATE

### 0. Authentication Redirect NOT WORKING
- **STATUS**: UNSOLVED - There is NO automatic redirect to login when authentication fails
- **PROBLEM**: The API client interceptor attempts `window.location.href = '/login'` on 401 errors
- **REALITY**: This redirect is NOT working properly - users see errors instead of being redirected
- **IMPACT**: When tokens expire, users get stuck with error messages instead of login page
- **TODO**: This needs to be properly fixed - the redirect mechanism is broken

### 1. UI Debugging Order - ALWAYS START WITH VISUAL
- **FIRST**: Check if element exists in DOM (Inspect Element)
- **SECOND**: Check if element is visible (CSS: display, opacity, z-index, position)
- **THIRD**: Check if element is interactive (pointer-events, disabled)
- **LAST**: Debug state, props, API calls
- **WHY**: Visual issues have visual causes - don't debug backend when frontend doesn't render

### 2. Component Library Fallback Rule
- **RULE**: After 3 failed attempts to fix a library component, implement custom solution
- **APPLIES TO**: Modals, dropdowns, complex UI components with portals/z-index
- **CUSTOM APPROACH**: Use `fixed inset-0` positioning + basic HTML/CSS + proper UI components inside
- **WHY**: Library components can have invisible failures (portal conflicts, CSS-in-JS issues, build problems)

### 3. Authentication Guard Order
- **NEVER** make PermissionsGuard global
- **ALWAYS** use guards in this order: `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PermissionsGuard)`
- **WHY**: Global guards execute before controller guards, breaking authentication

### 2. Controller Paths
- **NEVER** include 'api' in controller paths
- **CORRECT**: `@Controller('customers')`
- **WRONG**: `@Controller('api/customers')`
- **WHY**: Main.ts already sets global prefix '/api'

### 3. Process Management
- **NEVER** use `pkill -f "node"` (kills the AI terminal)
- **USE**: Specific process names like `pkill -f "nest start"`
- **WHY**: Broad kill commands can terminate the development environment

### 4. API Build & Startup
- **ALWAYS** fix API issues properly - no workarounds
- **FIRST** check if API is already built: `ls apps/api/dist/`
- **PROBLEM**: NestJS build creates nested structure (dist/apps/api/src/main.js)
- **PROPER FIX**: Use the npm scripts that handle this complexity
- **WHY**: Workarounds create technical debt and hide real issues

### 5. Package Management
- **ALWAYS** build packages before API: `npm run build -w @heya-pos/types -w @heya-pos/utils`
- **NEVER** point package.json to .ts files in production
- **ENSURE** packages have proper exports in package.json
- **WHY**: TypeScript can't resolve .ts imports at runtime

## üìö Knowledge Base

### Project Structure
```
/apps/api          # NestJS backend (port 3000)
/apps/merchant-app # Next.js merchant UI (port 3002)
/packages          # Shared packages
/docs              # All documentation
```

### Authentication Flow
1. Merchant logs in ‚Üí JWT token generated
2. Token includes merchantId and type
3. JwtAuthGuard validates token and attaches user to request
4. PermissionsGuard checks permissions (merchants have '*')
5. PIN auth removed from UI flow

### Database
- Type: SQLite (`/apps/api/prisma/dev.db`)
- Test Merchants: 
  - Luxe Beauty & Wellness (luxeadmin/testpassword123)
  - Hamilton Beauty Spa (HAMILTON/password123)

## üîß Common Tasks & Solutions

### Start Everything
```bash
npm run api:dev      # Start API
npm run merchant:dev # Start merchant app
# OR
npm run dev:all      # Start both
```

### Debug Authentication Issues
```bash
# Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/merchant/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "luxeadmin", "password": "testpassword123"}'

# Test protected endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/debug/auth
```

### Fix Common Problems
| Problem | Solution | Prevention |
|---------|----------|------------|
| 403 "User not authenticated" | Check guard order | Always: JWT ‚Üí Permissions |
| 404 with /api/api/... | Remove 'api' from controller | Check controller decorators |
| Port already in use | `lsof -ti:3000 \| xargs kill -9` | Use npm scripts |
| Module not found '/dist/main' | See "API Won't Start" below | Build packages first |
| ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND | Build packages with tsup | Update package.json exports |
| Dialog/Modal not visible | Create custom modal with `fixed inset-0` | Skip complex library components |
| Button seems broken | Check DOM exists ‚Üí CSS visible ‚Üí Interactivity | Don't debug backend first |

### API Won't Start - Quick Fix Guide
```bash
# 1. Check if already running
ps aux | grep nest

# 2. Build packages first
cd packages/types && npm run build
cd ../utils && npm run build

# 3. Try direct node execution
cd apps/api
ls dist/  # Check what's there
node dist/main.js  # Try the actual file

# 4. If nothing works, use dev mode
npm run start:dev  # Let it compile on the fly
```

## üìä Session History & Learnings

### Session 2025-05-30: Calendar Page Freezing Issue
**Duration**: ~15 minutes (but took 3 attempts)
**Problem**: Calendar page freezing after closing New Booking slider - page becomes unresponsive
**Root Cause**: SlideOutPanel component with `preserveState={true}` kept invisible overlay in DOM
**Solution**: Set `preserveState={false}` on BookingSlideOut component

**Why It Took Multiple Attempts**:
1. **First Attempt - Wrong Root Cause**: 
   - Focused on `document.body.style.overflow` not being reset
   - Added timeouts and forced resets
   - This was a symptom, not the cause

2. **Second Attempt - Partial Understanding**:
   - Found the overlay wasn't getting `pointer-events-none` when invisible
   - Fixed the overlay CSS but didn't realize the real issue
   - Still didn't solve the problem because overlay shouldn't exist at all

3. **Third Attempt - Real Root Cause**:
   - Finally checked the `preserveState` prop behavior
   - Realized `shouldRender` never became false with `preserveState={true}`
   - Invisible components were staying in DOM blocking all interactions

**Key Mistake Pattern**:
```
Symptom: Page frozen/unresponsive
Wrong: Debug body overflow ‚Üí Add CSS fixes ‚Üí Add more workarounds
Right: What's blocking clicks? ‚Üí Invisible elements? ‚Üí Why are they still there?
```

**Critical Learnings**:
1. **Invisible Elements Can Block Everything**: Elements with `opacity-0` without `pointer-events-none` catch all clicks
2. **State Preservation Has Side Effects**: `preserveState={true}` keeps components in DOM even when "closed"
3. **Debug What's There, Not What Should Be**: Use DevTools to see if invisible elements exist
4. **Component Props Matter**: Default prop values can cause unexpected behavior
5. **Z-Index Layers Are Critical**: High z-index elements (z-40, z-50) will block everything below

**Debugging Strategy for Frozen UI**:
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Elements tab
2. Look for high z-index elements (`fixed` position, z-40+)
3. Check if they have `pointer-events-none` when invisible
4. Check if they should exist at all when "closed"
5. Trace back to component lifecycle/state management

**Pattern to Remember**:
- Modal/Slider closes but page frozen = Invisible overlay still exists
- Always check: Does the overlay get removed from DOM or just hidden?
- Component libraries often preserve state by default for performance
- When in doubt, set `preserveState={false}` for modals/sliders

### Session 2025-05-29: UI Component Dialog Issues 
**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Problem**: Service creation dialog button did nothing - appeared to work but no dialog shown
**Root Cause**: Radix UI Dialog component had portal rendering/z-index conflicts
**Solution**: Replaced complex Radix Dialog with custom modal using reliable CSS positioning

**Debugging Journey & Time Wasted**:
1. **Wrong Problem Diagnosis** (20 mins): Assumed API/auth issues, debugged backend
2. **Component Library Faith** (30 mins): Kept trying to "fix" Radix Dialog with CSS overrides
3. **Incremental Debugging** (25 mins): Fixed authentication, validation, imports - all irrelevant
4. **Portal/Z-index Hunting** (15 mins): Added z-index overrides, portal CSS - still invisible

**Key Mistake Pattern**:
```
Symptom: Button doesn't work
Wrong: Debug API ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Backend
Right: Debug UI ‚Üí Can you see it? ‚Üí Is it clickable? ‚Üí Does it render?
```

**Critical Learnings**:
1. **Visual Issues Need Visual Debugging**: If something doesn't appear, start with "is it rendered in DOM?"
2. **Component Libraries Aren't Magic**: Complex components (portals, z-index, CSS-in-JS) can fail silently
3. **Simple Solutions Often Win**: Custom `fixed inset-0` modal more reliable than fancy component
4. **Debug in Right Order**: Start with simplest explanation (CSS/positioning) before complex ones (state/API)
5. **Know When to Abandon**: After 3 failed attempts at fixing library component, try custom implementation

**Pattern to Avoid**:
```
1. Complex component doesn't work ‚Üí Try CSS fixes
2. Still doesn't work ‚Üí Try more CSS fixes  
3. Still doesn't work ‚Üí Debug unrelated systems
4. Still doesn't work ‚Üí More CSS fixes
5. Finally ‚Üí Rewrite with simple approach ‚ùå
```

**Better Approach**:
```
1. Component doesn't work ‚Üí Quick check: DOM exists? CSS visible?
2. Still doesn't work ‚Üí Try simple implementation immediately
3. Simple works ‚Üí Keep it, document the library issue ‚úÖ
```

**UI Debugging Checklist for Future**:
- [ ] Is the element in the DOM? (Inspect element)
- [ ] Is it visible? (Check CSS: display, opacity, z-index)
- [ ] Is it positioned correctly? (Check: fixed, absolute, transform)
- [ ] Is it interactive? (Check: pointer-events, disabled state)
- [ ] ONLY THEN debug state/props/API

### Session 2025-05-27: Authentication Debugging
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Problem**: E2E tests failing with 403 errors
**Root Cause**: PermissionsGuard was global, executing before JwtAuthGuard
**Solution**: Removed global guard, added to controllers in correct order
**Learnings**:
1. Guard execution order is critical in NestJS
2. Global guards run before controller-level guards
3. Always test with simple endpoints first
4. 500 errors need investigation in service layer

**Mistakes Made**:
- Spent time debugging JWT when auth was actually working
- Initially missed the double /api prefix issue
- Almost killed the terminal with broad pkill command

### Session 2025-05-27: E2E Testing & API Build Loop
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Problem**: Stuck in repeated API build/startup failures
**Root Cause**: Multiple interconnected issues:
1. NestJS build creates wrong directory structure
2. Packages pointing to .ts files instead of compiled .js
3. Module resolution failures at runtime
4. noEmit: true inherited from parent tsconfig

**Time Wasted**: 
- 30+ minutes trying different tsconfig combinations
- Multiple build attempts with same result
- Debugging module paths that were fundamentally broken

**Key Learning**: Fix API issues immediately!
- Don't work around them - they'll only get worse
- Use the proper scripts (`npm run clean-start`)
- Every workaround creates future problems

**Pattern to Avoid**:
```
1. Try to start API ‚Üí fails
2. Debug build config ‚Üí partial fix
3. Build packages ‚Üí success
4. Rebuild API ‚Üí different error
5. Debug new error ‚Üí rabbit hole
6. REPEAT... ‚ùå
```

**Better Approach**:
```
1. API won't start? ‚Üí Use npm run status & restart ‚úÖ
2. Still broken? ‚Üí Use npm run clean-start ‚úÖ
3. Fix root cause ‚Üí No tech debt ‚úÖ
```

## üéØ Optimization Strategies

### Smart Problem Solving

When facing API issues:
1. **Use the right tools**
   - `npm run status` - What's actually running?
   - `npm run restart` - Clean restart
   - `npm run clean-start` - Full reset with cache clearing

2. **Fix root causes**
   - Port conflicts? ‚Üí Proper shutdown/startup
   - Build errors? ‚Üí Build packages first
   - Module errors? ‚Üí Check package exports

3. **No workarounds**
   - Every shortcut creates debt
   - Fix it now or waste hours later
   - The scripts exist for a reason - use them!

### For Future Sessions
1. **First Steps**:
   ```bash
   ./check-docs.sh          # Quick status check
   cat docs/CHECK_FIRST.md  # Critical warnings
   npm run ps:check         # See what's running
   ```

2. **Before Changing Auth**:
   - Test current state with debug endpoint
   - Check guard order in controllers
   - Never modify global guards

3. **When Debugging**:
   - Start with health check endpoints
   - Use debug endpoints before complex ones
   - Check logs for stack traces on 500 errors

## üìù Pending Issues

### High Priority
1. **Customer Service**: Returns 500 error
   - Need to debug service implementation
   - Check Prisma queries and relations

2. **Booking Service**: Returns 500 error
   - Validate DTO requirements
   - Check required fields vs provided data

### Low Priority
1. Implement proper error handling
2. Add request logging middleware
3. Create API integration tests

## üîç Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Check API routes
curl http://localhost:3000/api | jq

# Test auth flow
npm run test:auth

# View recent logs
npm run api:logs

# Database status
cd apps/api && npx prisma studio
```

## ‚ö° Efficiency Tips

1. **Use the npm scripts** - Don't manually manage processes
2. **Check this file first** - Avoid repeating solved problems
3. **Test incrementally** - Simple endpoints before complex ones
4. **Read error messages** - 403 vs 500 tells you where to look
5. **Keep services running** - Use separate terminals

## üìö Important Debugging Principles

### Always Investigate Root Causes Before Implementing Workarounds
**Added**: 2025-06-03

When encountering import errors or "missing" components:
1. **FIRST**: Check if the component exists in the codebase
2. **SECOND**: Verify it's exported from package index files
3. **THIRD**: Look for working examples in other files
4. **NEVER**: Jump straight to implementing a workaround

**Example**: Staff page DataTable "missing" - Actually existed in UI package, just needed proper import.

**Cost of Workarounds**:
- Technical debt accumulation
- Loss of features (pagination, sorting, etc.)
- Inconsistent user experience
- More work to fix later

**See**: `/docs/sessions/2025-06-03-component-import-debugging.md` for detailed case study
