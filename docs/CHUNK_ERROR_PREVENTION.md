# Chunk Error Prevention Guide

## Overview
ChunkLoadError occurs when webpack chunks fail to load, usually due to:
- Network timeouts
- Cache mismatches after deployments
- Ad blockers or browser extensions
- Corporate proxies or firewalls

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Error Handler
Located in `/apps/merchant-app/src/lib/chunk-error-handler.ts`:
- Automatically retries failed chunks up to 3 times
- Increases chunk load timeout to 30 seconds
- Auto-reloads page after first few failures
- Shows user-friendly notifications
- Handles both sync and async (dynamic import) failures

### 2. Webpack Configuration
In `next.config.js`:
- Increased chunk load timeout to 2 minutes
- Better chunk naming for cache busting
- Optimized chunk splitting strategy
- Added CORS headers for better error handling

### 3. Caching Headers
- Immutable caching for static assets
- Proper cache headers for `_next/static/*` paths

## Additional Prevention Measures

### For Development
1. Clear browser cache regularly
2. Use incognito/private browsing for testing
3. Disable browser extensions during development

### For Production
1. **Use a CDN**: Serve static assets from a CDN for better reliability
2. **Service Worker**: Implement offline caching
3. **Preload Critical Chunks**: Add preload hints for critical chunks
4. **Monitor Errors**: Track chunk errors in production

### Quick Fixes When Errors Occur

1. **Hard Refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear Cache**: 
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy & Security → Clear Data
3. **Disable Extensions**: Test in incognito mode
4. **Check Network**: Ensure stable internet connection

## Implementation Status

✅ Automatic retry mechanism
✅ Extended timeouts
✅ User notifications
✅ Cache busting
✅ Error tracking
✅ Auto-recovery

## Testing the Error Handler

To test if the chunk error handler is working:

1. Open DevTools Network tab
2. Set network to "Offline" 
3. Navigate between pages
4. You should see the error notification and auto-reload

## Future Improvements

1. **Implement Service Worker** for offline support
2. **Add telemetry** to track which chunks fail most often
3. **Implement chunk preloading** for critical paths
4. **Add manual retry button** in error notification
