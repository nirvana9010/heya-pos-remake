# Booking Availability Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Database Query Bug in BookingAvailabilityService

**Problem**: The availability check was using incorrect date filtering:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
endTime: {
  lte: endDate,  // Only finds bookings ending BEFORE the range
}
```

**Fix Applied**: Changed to proper overlap detection:
```typescript
// AFTER (correct):
startTime: {
  lt: endDate,  // Booking starts before range ends
},
endTime: {
  gt: startDate,  // Booking ends after range starts
}
```

**Location**: `apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/booking-availability.service.ts` (lines 85-92)

### 2. Error Message Not Displayed to Customers

**Problem**: The booking app was showing a generic error message instead of the actual API error:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
description: "Failed to create booking. Please try again.",
```

**Fix Applied**: Changed to display the actual error message:
```typescript
// AFTER:
description: error.message || "Failed to create booking. Please try again.",
```

**Location**: `apps/booking-app/src/app/booking/BookingPageClient.tsx` (line 416)

## Current Status

### Working ✅
1. **Booking Creation**: Correctly detects and rejects conflicting bookings
2. **Error Messages**: Actual error messages are now shown to customers
3. **Conflict Detection**: The booking creation logic properly checks for overlapping time slots

### Still Has Issues ⚠️
1. **Availability Display**: The availability check endpoint still shows booked slots as available
   - This appears to be a more complex issue possibly related to:
     - How the query results are processed
     - Timezone handling between the database and application
     - The way slots are generated and checked

## Testing Results

When testing the fixes:
- ✅ Conflicting bookings are correctly rejected with the message "This time slot is no longer available"
- ✅ The error message is properly displayed in the UI
- ⚠️ The availability check still shows booked slots as available (but at least bookings are rejected)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: The current fixes improve the user experience by:
   - Preventing double bookings (even if slots appear available)
   - Showing clear error messages when conflicts occur

2. **Follow-up Investigation Needed**: 
   - The availability check logic needs deeper investigation
   - Consider adding integration tests for the availability service
   - May need to review timezone handling throughout the booking flow

## How to Test

1. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-booking-fixes.js
   ```

2. Expected behavior:
   - Creating a booking should succeed
   - Checking availability should show the slot as unavailable (currently fails)
   - Attempting to create a conflicting booking should fail with proper error message

## Files Modified

1. `apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/booking-availability.service.ts`
2. `apps/booking-app/src/app/booking/BookingPageClient.tsx`

## Next Steps

The availability display issue requires further investigation. The core functionality (preventing double bookings) is working, but the UI may show slots as available when they're actually booked. This creates a suboptimal user experience where users might select unavailable slots and then see an error.
