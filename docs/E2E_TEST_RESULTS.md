## Summary

### Working Features:
1. Authentication flow (without PIN)
2. Basic booking creation and listing
3. Navigation and routing
4. Mock data integration

### Major Issues:
1. Real API not starting due to build/module issues
2. No persistence (using in-memory mock data)
3. Several features not implemented (calendar, reports, payments)
4. No real-time updates

### Recommendations:
1. Fix API build configuration to resolve module resolution issues
2. Implement missing UI features (calendar, reports)
3. Add proper error handling for API failures
4. Implement data persistence (either localStorage for mock or fix API)
5. Add loading states and error boundaries
6. Implement missing booking operations (update, cancel)

## Next Steps:
1. Resolve API startup issues
2. Switch from mockApi to real API endpoints
3. Test with persistent data
4. Implement missing features
5. Add automated E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
