# Owner PIN Implementation Summary

## Overview
The owner PIN system has been implemented to replace the hardcoded demo PIN (1234) with a proper owner-based PIN system that includes account creation and PIN management.

## Key Components

### 1. PinProtected Component (`/components/PinProtected.tsx`)
- Wraps sensitive features requiring PIN protection
- ALWAYS checks for owner existence and PIN setup first (regardless of feature)
- Shows appropriate setup flow if missing
- No session storage - PIN required every time
- Supports features: reports, refunds, cancellations, settings, void, discounts, staff

### 2. SetupOwnerPin Component (`/components/SetupOwnerPin.tsx`)
- Two-step setup flow:
  1. Create owner account (if none exists)
  2. Set owner PIN
- Validates PIN format (4-8 digits)
- Creates staff member with OWNER role
- Updates PIN after creation

### 3. API Extensions (`/lib/api-extensions/pin-api.ts`)
- Mock implementation for development
- Methods:
  - `getPinStatus()` - Check if PIN is set
  - `setPin(pin, role)` - Set owner PIN
  - `verifyPin(pin, feature, role)` - Verify entered PIN
  - `checkOwnerExists()` - Check for owner account

## Implementation Details

### Owner Account Creation
```javascript
// Required fields for staff creation
{
  email: "owner@example.com",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  phone: "", // Optional
  pin: "0000", // Temporary, updated after creation
  role: "OWNER",
  accessLevel: 10, // Maximum
  permissions: ["*"], // Full access
  commissionRate: 0,
  calendarColor: "#8B5CF6",
  locationIds: [] // All locations
}
```

### PIN Verification Flow
1. User navigates to ANY protected feature (reports, settings, refunds, etc.)
2. System ALWAYS checks if owner exists first
   - If not → Show owner creation form
3. System checks if owner has PIN
   - If not → Show PIN setup form
4. User enters PIN
5. System verifies against stored PIN
6. Access granted or denied

**Important**: The owner/PIN check happens for ANY feature that uses PinProtected, not just reports. This ensures consistent security across all protected features.

### Security Features
- No hardcoded demo PINs
- PIN required on every access (no session storage)
- 4-8 digit numeric PINs only
- Maximum 3 failed attempts before lockout
- Environment-specific behavior (no hints in production)

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test script:
```bash
node scripts/test-owner-pin-system.js
```

### UI Test Page
Navigate to `/test-owner-pin` for interactive testing

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to Reports page
2. Complete owner setup if needed
3. Test PIN entry and validation
4. Verify no session persistence
5. Test settings toggles

## Current Status

### ✅ Implemented
- Owner account creation flow
- PIN setup and validation
- PinProtected wrapper component
- Reports page protection
- Mock API for development
- No session storage (PIN every time)
- Environment-based hints removal

### ⚠️ Pending (for production)
- Real API endpoints for PIN management
- PIN hashing/encryption
- Database storage for PINs
- Audit logging
- PIN reset functionality
- Rate limiting on failed attempts

## Migration Notes

### From Demo PIN to Owner PIN
1. All references to demo PIN (1234) have been removed
2. System now requires actual owner account
3. PIN tied to specific owner staff member
4. No role-based bypasses

### Breaking Changes
- Demo PIN no longer works
- Must create owner account before PIN setup
- PIN required every time (no 15-minute memory)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Protection
```tsx
// Protect a component
import { PinProtected } from "@/components/PinProtected";

export default function SensitiveFeature() {
  return (
    <PinProtected 
      feature="reports"
      title="Reports Access Required"
      description="Enter your PIN to view reports"
    >
      {/* Protected content here */}
    </PinProtected>
  );
}
```

### Protecting Settings
```tsx
export function SettingsPage() {
  return (
    <PinProtected 
      feature="settings"
      title="Settings Access Required"
      description="Enter your PIN to modify system settings"
    >
      <SettingsContent />
    </PinProtected>
  );
}
```

### Protecting Specific Actions
```tsx
export function VoidTransactionButton({ transactionId }: Props) {
  const handleVoid = () => {
    // Void logic here
  };

  return (
    <PinProtected 
      feature="void"
      title="Void Transaction"
      description="PIN required to void this transaction"
    >
      <Button onClick={handleVoid} variant="destructive">
        Void Transaction
      </Button>
    </PinProtected>
  );
}
```

### Available Features
- `reports` - Financial reports and analytics
- `refunds` - Payment refunds
- `cancellations` - Late booking cancellations
- `settings` - System configuration
- `void` - Void transactions
- `discounts` - Discount overrides
- `staff` - Staff management
