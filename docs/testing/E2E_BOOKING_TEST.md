# E2E Booking Creation Test Results

## Summary
After extensive debugging, we discovered and fixed a critical authentication issue in the API:

### Root Cause
The `PermissionsGuard` was registered as a GLOBAL guard, executing BEFORE the `JwtAuthGuard`. This caused all protected endpoints to fail with "User not authenticated" because the user hadn't been authenticated yet.

### Solution Applied
1. Removed `PermissionsGuard` from global guards in `app.module.ts`
2. Added `PermissionsGuard` to each controller AFTER `JwtAuthGuard`
3. This ensures proper execution order: JWT auth → User attached → Permissions checked

### Current Status
- ✅ Authentication is working correctly
- ✅ JWT tokens are valid and user is properly attached to requests
- ❌ Customer and Booking endpoints return 500 errors (internal service issues)

## Manual UI Testing Instructions

Since the API endpoints have internal errors, test booking creation through the UI:

### 1. Access the Application
- URL: http://localhost:3002
- You should be redirected to the login page

### 2. Login
- Username: `luxeadmin`
- Password: `testpassword123`
- You should be redirected directly to the dashboard (no PIN required)

### 3. Create a New Booking
- Click "New Booking" button on dashboard
- Or navigate to http://localhost:3002/bookings/new

### 4. Fill Booking Form
Test data to use:
- **Customer**: Olivia Mitchell (or create new)
- **Service**: Signature Hydrating Facial ($150, 60 min)
- **Staff**: Emma Wilson
- **Date**: Tomorrow
- **Time**: 2:00 PM
- **Location**: Sydney CBD

### 5. Expected Results
- Booking should be created successfully
- Booking number should be generated
- Should appear in calendar view
- Should show in bookings list

## Next Steps

### Fix API Issues
The 500 errors in the API need investigation:
1. Check customer service implementation
2. Check booking service implementation
3. Verify database queries and relations
4. Add proper error handling and logging

### Alternative Testing Approach
Consider using:
1. **Playwright** or **Cypress** for UI automation
2. **Supertest** for API integration tests
3. **Mock data** to bypass service layer issues

## Key Learnings

1. **Guard Execution Order Matters**: Global guards run before controller guards
2. **Debug Incrementally**: Start with simple endpoints to verify auth works
3. **Check Logs**: 500 errors usually have stack traces in console
4. **Test UI and API Separately**: When API fails, test UI with mock data

```

### `/apps/api/src/customers/customers.controller.ts`
```typescript
// Changed from:
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
// To:
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PermissionsGuard)
```

### `/apps/api/src/bookings/bookings.controller.ts`
