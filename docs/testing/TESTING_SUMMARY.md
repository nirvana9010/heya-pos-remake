# E2E Testing Summary

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
1. **Database**: SQLite database with test data (2 merchants, customers, services, etc.)
2. **API Server**: Running on port 3000
3. **Merchant App**: Running on port 3002
4. **Authentication**: JWT tokens are generated correctly
5. **Auth Endpoints**: `/api/auth/merchant/login` and `/api/auth/me` work

### ❌ Issues Found
1. **Controller Routing**: Controllers have duplicate `/api` prefix
   - Current: `/api/api/customers`, `/api/api/bookings`
   - Should be: `/api/customers`, `/api/bookings`

2. **JWT Guard**: Not properly attaching user to request for protected endpoints
   - PermissionsGuard receives request without user
   - Results in 403 "User not authenticated" errors

3. **Session Service**: JWT guard expects session but may not be properly initialized

## Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Removed PIN requirement from merchant app login flow
2. ✅ Updated login to redirect directly to dashboard
3. ✅ Fixed controller paths (removed 'api/' prefix)
4. ✅ Added comprehensive npm scripts for API management

## Fixes Needed
1. Restart API server with corrected controller paths
2. Debug why JWT strategy isn't attaching user to request
3. Ensure PermissionsGuard can access authenticated user

## Test Credentials
- **Merchant Login**: 
  - Username: `luxeadmin`
  - Password: `testpassword123`
  - URL: http://localhost:3002/login

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Test booking creation through the UI (bypass API issues)
2. Fix the authentication middleware chain
3. Create integration tests that work with the current auth setup
4. Document the proper API endpoint structure

## Key Learnings
- The API uses a global `/api` prefix set in main.ts
- Controllers should not include 'api' in their paths
- JWT authentication works but request enrichment fails
- The app expects both merchant auth and staff PIN auth for certain operations
