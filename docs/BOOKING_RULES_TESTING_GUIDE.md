## Overview

Advance booking hours and cancellation notice are **critical business rules** that directly impact revenue and operations. This guide ensures these settings work reliably.

## üöÄ Quick Test Methods

### 1. Automated UI Test
Navigate to: `/settings/test-booking-rules`
- Visual test interface
- Real-time results
- Tests all edge cases automatically

### 2. Command Line Test
```bash
# Get auth token
AUTH_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/merchant/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "HAMILTON", "password": "demo123"}' | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*' | cut -d'"' -f4)

# Run tests

```

### 3. Manual Testing
Follow the step-by-step guide below

## üìè Understanding the Rules

### Advance Booking Hours
- **Purpose**: Prevents last-minute bookings that staff can't prepare for
- **Example**: If set to 48 hours, customers cannot book for today or tomorrow
- **Business Impact**: Ensures adequate preparation time

### Cancellation Notice Hours  
- **Purpose**: Prevents revenue loss from last-minute cancellations
- **Example**: If set to 24 hours, customers cannot cancel bookings starting within 24 hours
- **Business Impact**: May require deposits or fees for late cancellations

## üîÑ Edge Case Testing

### Time Zone Considerations
```
1. Set timezone to Perth (UTC+8)
2. Create booking for "tomorrow 10am Perth time"
3. Change timezone to Sydney (UTC+10/11)
4. Verify booking still shows correct relative time
5. Test if advance hours still enforced correctly
```

### Daylight Saving Transitions
```
1. Test bookings that cross DST boundaries
2. Ensure 24h means 24 actual hours, not "same time tomorrow"
```

### Concurrent Updates
```
1. Admin A: Set advance hours to 24
2. Admin B: Try to book 12 hours ahead (should fail)
3. Admin A: Change to 6 hours
4. Admin B: Retry booking (should succeed)
```

## üì± Multi-Channel Testing

Test that rules are enforced across ALL booking channels:

### 1. Admin/Staff Portal

- [ ] New booking form
- [ ] Quick booking button
- [ ] Modify existing booking

### 2. Customer Portal (if enabled)
- [ ] Online booking widget
- [ ] Mobile booking app
- [ ] Phone booking (staff enters)

### 3. API/Integrations
- [ ] Direct API calls
- [ ] Third-party integrations

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Rules Not Enforcing
**Symptoms**: Can book/cancel without restrictions
**Check**:
- Settings actually saved? (refresh and check)
- Using correct API version? (v2 for bookings)
- Client-side validation disabled?

### Issue 2: Wrong Time Calculations
**Symptoms**: Blocks valid bookings, allows invalid ones
**Check**:
- Server timezone matches setting timezone?
- Client sending UTC timestamps?
- DST handling correct?

### Issue 3: Inconsistent Enforcement
**Symptoms**: Works in calendar but not booking form
**Check**:
- All UI components reading from same settings?
- Validation in both frontend AND backend?
- Cache invalidation after settings change?
