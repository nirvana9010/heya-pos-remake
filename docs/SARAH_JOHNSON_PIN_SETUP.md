# Sarah Johnson PIN Setup Guide

## Current Situation
- **Owner**: Sarah Johnson already exists as owner-level staff (Access Level 3)
- **PIN Status**: No PIN set yet
- **Expected Flow**: Should skip owner creation and go directly to PIN setup

## Test Steps

### 1. Navigate to Reports Page
- Go to `/reports`
- **Expected**: Should NOT show "Create Owner Account" form
- **Expected**: Should show "Set Owner PIN" form with Sarah Johnson's name

### 2. PIN Setup Screen
- **Title**: "Set Owner PIN"
- **Description**: "Sarah Johnson - Create a secure PIN for accessing sensitive features"
- Enter a PIN (e.g., 5678)
- Confirm the same PIN
- Click "Set Owner PIN"

### 3. After PIN Setup
- Reports page should load
- Sarah's PIN is now set and stored

### 4. Test PIN Access
- Navigate away from Reports
- Return to Reports page
- **Expected**: PIN entry prompt appears
- Enter the PIN you just set (5678)
- **Expected**: Access granted

## Technical Details

The system correctly identifies Sarah Johnson as owner because:
- She has `accessLevel: 3` (which means owner according to the Staff interface)
- The detection logic checks for:
  - `role === "OWNER"` OR
  - `accessLevel === 3` OR
  - Full permissions (`*`)

## What Changed

1. **Updated owner detection logic** to check for `accessLevel === 3`
2. **Shows owner name** in PIN setup form when owner already exists
3. **Skips owner creation** when Sarah Johnson (or any owner) already exists

## Important Notes

- The PIN is associated with the owner-level staff member
- Only one owner PIN is supported in the current implementation
- The PIN must be 4-8 digits
- No demo PIN (1234) will work - only the actual owner PIN
