# Loyalty System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented loyalty accrual for points-based programs when bookings are completed.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Module Integration
- Added `LoyaltyModule` to `BookingsContextModule` imports
- This enables the booking context to access loyalty services

### 2. Service Injection
- Injected `LoyaltyService` into `BookingUpdateService` constructor
- This allows the booking service to call loyalty processing methods

### 3. Booking Completion Hook
- Added loyalty processing in the `completeBooking` method
- Calls `loyaltyService.processBookingCompletion(bookingId)` after status update
- Wrapped in try-catch to prevent booking failure if loyalty processing fails

### 4. Loyalty Processing Logic
The `processBookingCompletion` method in LoyaltyService:
- Checks if booking status is COMPLETED
- Retrieves the merchant's loyalty program
- For VISITS programs: Increments visit count and creates transaction
- For POINTS programs: Calculates points based on booking amount and creates transaction
- Updates customer stats: visitCount, totalSpent, loyaltyPoints/loyaltyVisits

## Testing
Created test script at `/apps/api/test/test-loyalty-api.ts` that:
1. Logs in as merchant
2. Creates a booking via API
3. Starts the booking (changes status to IN_PROGRESS)
4. Completes the booking (triggers loyalty accrual)
5. Verifies customer stats were updated
6. Confirms loyalty transaction was created

## Results
For a $110 booking with Hamilton's VISITS-based program:
- Visit Count: +1
- Total Spent: +$110
- Loyalty Visits: +1
- Loyalty Transaction: Created with type "EARNED"

## Notes
- The system supports both VISITS (punch card) and POINTS based programs
- Hamilton uses a VISITS program (10 visits = free service)
- Points programs would accrue points based on `pointsPerDollar` setting
- Loyalty processing is resilient - failures don't break booking completion
