# Booking System Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Sync Issue
**Problem**: "The column `Customer.emailNotifications` does not exist in the current database"
**Fix**: Ran `npx prisma db push` to sync database with schema
**Prevention**: Created PRISMA_SYNC_GUIDE.md and check-prisma-sync.sh pre-commit hook

### 2. Availability Display Bug
**Problem**: Booked time slots were showing as available in the UI
**Root Causes**:
- Date range query in BookingAvailabilityService was incorrect
- Timezone handling was creating slots at wrong times
- Business hours were being checked with wrong day of week

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Fix 1: Date Range Query (booking-availability.service.ts)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Incorrect endTime filter
endTime: {
  gte: startDate,
  lte: endDate,
}

// AFTER: Proper overlap detection
startTime: {
  lt: endDate,
},
endTime: {
  gt: startDate,
}
```

#### Fix 2: Day of Week Calculation (booking-availability.service.ts)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Using UTC timezone
const dayOfWeek = format(currentDate, 'EEEE').toLowerCase();

// AFTER: Using location timezone
const dayOfWeek = currentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
  weekday: 'long', 
  timeZone: timezone 
}).toLowerCase();
```

#### Fix 3: TimezoneUtils.createDateInTimezone (timezone.ts)
- Simplified the method to correctly handle timezone conversion
- Fixed the offset calculation that was applying timezone adjustment incorrectly

#### Fix 4: Time Formatting (public-booking.service.ts)
```typescript
// Added fix for "24:xx" time format issue
if (time.startsWith('24:')) {
  time = '00:' + time.substring(3);
}
```

### 3. Error Message Display
**Problem**: Generic error messages instead of actual API errors
**Fix**: Updated BookingPageClient.tsx to show actual error messages:
```typescript
description: error.message || "Failed to create booking. Please try again.",
```

## Test Results

After all fixes:
- ✅ Availability correctly detects booked slots
- ✅ Slots are generated during correct business hours (9am-6pm)
- ✅ Timezone handling works correctly for Sydney time
- ✅ Error messages are properly displayed to users
- ✅ Booking creation and conflict detection work as expected

## Files Modified
1. `/apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/booking-availability.service.ts`
2. `/apps/api/src/contexts/bookings/application/services/public-booking.service.ts`
3. `/apps/api/src/utils/shared/timezone.ts`
4. `/apps/booking-app/src/app/booking/BookingPageClient.tsx`

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify timezone handling when dealing with date/time operations
2. Use proper date range queries for overlap detection
3. Ensure error messages are propagated to the UI for better user experience
4. Test with real data to catch edge cases early
