# Session Log: 2025-05-27 - Authentication Fix

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-05-27
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Main Task**: Fix E2E booking creation test
- **Outcome**: Identified and fixed authentication guard order issue

## Timeline

### 11:00 - Initial Problem
- User reported booking creation not working
- Started E2E test implementation
- Tests failing with 403 "User not authenticated"

### 11:15 - Debugging Authentication
- Created test scripts to verify auth flow
- Discovered /auth/me works but other endpoints fail
- Found controllers had duplicate /api prefix

### 11:30 - Key Discovery
- PermissionsGuard was registered as GLOBAL guard
- It was executing BEFORE JwtAuthGuard
- This caused user to not be attached when permissions checked

### 11:45 - Solution Implementation
1. Removed PermissionsGuard from global providers
2. Added guards to each controller in correct order
3. Fixed controller path prefixes

### 12:00 - Verification
- Authentication now working correctly
- Discovered new issue: 500 errors in service layer
- Created comprehensive documentation

## Code Changes

### app.module.ts
```diff
- providers: [
-   AppService,
-   {
-     provide: APP_GUARD,
-     useClass: PermissionsGuard,
-   },
- ],
+ providers: [
+   AppService,
+ ],
```

### Controllers
```diff
- @Controller('api/customers')
- @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
+ @Controller('customers')
+ @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PermissionsGuard)
```

## Mistakes & Learnings

### What Went Wrong
1. Assumed JWT wasn't working when it was
2. Didn't immediately check guard execution order
3. Almost used `pkill -f "node"` (would kill terminal)

### What Worked Well
1. Created debug endpoint to verify auth
2. Used incremental testing approach
3. Documented findings immediately

### Key Learnings
1. **Guard Order Matters**: Global → Controller → Method
2. **Debug Incrementally**: Simple endpoints first
3. **Check Logs**: 403 vs 500 tells different stories
4. **Document Everything**: Future sessions need context

## Tools Created
- `/api/debug/auth` endpoint for testing
- Test scripts for auth verification
- Comprehensive documentation structure

## Next Actions
1. Fix 500 errors in customer/booking services
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Create automated E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
