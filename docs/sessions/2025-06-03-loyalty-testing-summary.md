# Loyalty System Testing Summary - June 3, 2025

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed:**
1. Database schema updated with loyalty fields and models
2. Core loyalty service implemented with business logic
3. Loyalty controller with all required endpoints
4. Integration with booking completion flow
5. Support for both VISITS and POINTS systems

## Testing Challenges

### Authentication Issues
- JWT authentication on loyalty endpoints caused testing delays
- Temporarily disabled auth guards for testing (need to re-enable)
- User object not available when auth is disabled, causing crashes

### Key Findings
1. Database successfully migrated with all loyalty tables
2. Existing loyalty program found (Beauty Rewards - points based)
3. Successfully updated to visits-based punch card system
4. Customer creation working with proper phone format (+61...)
5. Booking integration hooked up correctly

## Test Data
- Merchant: HAMILTON (id: cmbcxfd6s0003vopjw80c3qpe)
- Test Customer: John Doe (id: cmbgdvybl0001vo8wdyow8n0f)
- Location: Hamilton Beauty Spa (id: cmbcxfd9z0007vopjy4jj9igu)
- Service: Basic Facial (id: cmbcxfdhs0009vopjwkgdv0g1)
- Staff: Emma Johnson (id: cmbcxfdq10017vopjyuqsjt8f)

## Quick Fix Needed

The loyalty controller needs merchant ID hardcoded for testing when auth is disabled:

```typescript
// In all endpoints that use user.merchantId:
const merchantId = user?.merchantId || 'cmbcxfd6s0003vopjw80c3qpe';
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix the auth/user object issue in loyalty controller
2. Complete end-to-end testing of visits earning
3. Test redemption flows
4. Re-enable authentication guards
5. Test points-based system
6. Create UI components for merchant app

## API Reference

```bash
# Login
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/merchant/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "HAMILTON", "password": "demo123"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

# Check program
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/loyalty/program

# Update to visits-based
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/loyalty/program \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "VISITS",
    "visitsRequired": 10,
    "visitRewardType": "FREE",
    "visitRewardValue": 100,

  }'
```

## Documentation Created
- `/docs/LOYALTY_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete system documentation
- `/apps/api/test/test-loyalty-system.ts` - Comprehensive test script

## Important Notes
- Phone numbers must be in international format (+61...)
- Booking must be COMPLETED to earn loyalty
- Each booking can only earn once (tracked by bookingId)
- Customer balances are separate for visits vs points
