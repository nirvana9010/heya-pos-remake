## 📊 Verification Methods

### API Testing
```bash
# Test settings endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchant/settings

# Update a setting
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bookingAdvanceHours": 48}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchant/settings
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check merchant settings
SELECT * FROM merchant_settings WHERE merchant_id = 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID';

-- Verify timezone is applied
SELECT created_at AT TIME ZONE 'Australia/Sydney' as sydney_time,
       created_at AT TIME ZONE 'Australia/Perth' as perth_time
FROM bookings LIMIT 1;
```

### UI Verification
1. Open Developer Tools > Application > Local Storage
2. Check for cached settings
3. Clear cache and verify settings reload from API
4. Check Network tab for correct API calls

## 🚨 Common Issues to Check

1. **Settings Not Persisting**
   - Check API returns 200 status
   - Verify database write permissions
   - Check for JavaScript errors

2. **Timezone Issues**
   - Verify server timezone configuration
   - Check date serialization format
   - Ensure consistent timezone handling

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify user role has settings permission
   - Check JWT token includes correct role
   - Verify API endpoint authorization

4. **Validation Failures**
   - Test boundary values (0, negative, very large)
   - Check required field validation
   - Verify data type constraints

## 📝 Test Recording Template

Previous Value: [Value]
New Value: [Value]
Expected Result: [Description]
Actual Result: [Description]

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A setting is considered fully functional when:
1. ✅ Value can be changed through UI
2. ✅ Change persists after page refresh
3. ✅ Change persists after logout/login
4. ✅ Business logic respects the setting
5. ✅ Related features update accordingly
6. ✅ No errors in console or network

## 🔄 Regression Testing

After any code changes, re-test:

2. Security settings (PINs, permissions)
3. Integration points (booking rules, notifications)
4. Recently changed settings
5. Settings that depend on changed code

**Remember**: A setting that saves but doesn't affect behavior is broken! Always verify the business logic respects the setting value.
