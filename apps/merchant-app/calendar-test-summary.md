# Calendar Implementation Test Summary

## Test Date: 2025-06-25

## 1. ✅ API Endpoints Status
All calendar-related API endpoints are working correctly:
- **Authentication**: `/api/v1/auth/merchant/login` - Working
- **Bookings**: `/api/v2/bookings` - Working (returns paginated data)
- **Staff**: `/api/v1/staff` - Working (4 staff members)
- **Services**: `/api/v1/services` - Working (12 services)
- **Customers**: `/api/v1/customers` - Working (20 customers)

## 2. ✅ Data Structure
The booking data structure is correct and contains all required fields:
- ID, customer details, service info, staff assignment
- Start/end times with proper timezone handling
- Status tracking (CONFIRMED, etc.)
- All fields needed for calendar display are present

## 3. ✅ Calendar Data Hooks
The `useCalendarData` hook correctly:
- Transforms the `date` parameter to `startDate`/`endDate` for v2 API
- Handles data transformation from API format to calendar format
- Manages loading states and error handling
- Fetches all required data (bookings, staff, services, customers)

## 4. ✅ Component Structure
The refactored calendar implementation has:
- Proper error boundary for catching React rendering errors
- CalendarProvider for state management
- Separate view components (DailyView, WeeklyView, MonthlyView)
- Drag-and-drop functionality hooks
- Time grid generation (7 AM - 9 PM in 30-minute slots)

## 5. ⚠️ Browser Testing Required
To fully verify the calendar UI:
1. The calendar page requires browser session authentication
2. Server-side rendering redirects to login without proper session
3. Need to test in actual browser environment

## 6. Known Issues Found
- None identified in the API or data layer
- All hooks and data transformations working correctly
- No console errors related to calendar functionality

## Recommendations for Manual Testing

1. **Login Test**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3002
   - Login with username: `HAMILTON`, password: `demo123`
   - Verify successful authentication

2. **Calendar Page Test**:
   - Navigate to `/calendar` after login
   - Check that the page loads without errors
   - Verify bookings are displayed

3. **View Tests**:
   - Test switching between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views
   - Verify navigation (previous/next/today buttons)
   - Check that dates display correctly

4. **Drag and Drop Test**:
   - Try dragging a booking to a different time slot
   - Verify the booking updates correctly
   - Check for conflict detection

5. **Unassigned Column Test**:
   - Toggle the "Show Unassigned" switch
   - Verify unassigned bookings appear/disappear

6. **Create Booking Test**:
   - Click "New Booking" button
   - Verify the slide-out opens
   - Test creating a new booking

## Summary
The calendar implementation appears to be working correctly at the API and data layer. All required endpoints are functional, data structures are proper, and the React components are well-structured with proper error handling. Manual browser testing is needed to verify the UI interactions and visual rendering.
