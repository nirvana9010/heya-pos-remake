# V2 Bookings Migration Report

## Overview
This report documents the migration from the legacy bookings module to the V2 bounded context with CQRS and Outbox patterns.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug in V2 Bookings Endpoint
**Issue**: The `/v2/bookings` endpoint was failing with a Prisma validation error due to `skip: NaN` and missing `take` parameter.
**Root Cause**: Improper handling of undefined pagination parameters in `GetBookingsListHandler`.
**Fix Applied**: Added proper null checks and default values using `Math.max()` to ensure valid pagination values.

### 2. Missing Public Endpoint
**Issue**: The booking app was calling `/api/public/service-categories` which didn't exist.
**Fix Applied**: Added the endpoint to `PublicBookingController` to return service categories for the active merchant.

### 3. Removed V1 Endpoints Still Being Called

#### a. `/v1/bookings/today`
**Used By**: `merchant-app/src/lib/api.ts`
**Fix Applied**: Updated to use `apiClient.getBookings()` with date filtering to get today's bookings.

#### b. `/v1/dashboard/stats`
**Used By**: `merchant-app/src/lib/api.ts`
**Status**: No backend implementation exists. The apiClient already has a fallback that calculates stats from available data.
**Fix Applied**: Updated to use `apiClient.getDashboardStats()` which has the fallback logic.

### 4. Generic Status Update Endpoint Removed
**Issue**: V2 removed the generic `/bookings/:id/status` endpoint in favor of specific action endpoints.
**V2 Endpoints**:
- `PATCH /v2/bookings/:id/start` - Start a booking
- `PATCH /v2/bookings/:id/complete` - Complete a booking
- `PATCH /v2/bookings/:id/cancel` - Cancel a booking

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added specific methods to apiClient: `startBooking()`, `completeBooking()`, `cancelBooking()`
- Made `updateBookingStatus()` a deprecated wrapper that maps to the specific methods
- Frontend components still using `updateBookingStatus()` will work but show a console warning

## Frontend Components That Need Updates

### 1. BookingsPageContent.tsx
- Line 258: Uses `updateBookingStatus(bookingId, 'IN_PROGRESS')`
- Should be updated to: `startBooking(bookingId)`

### 2. calendar-enhanced.tsx
- Has an `updateBookingStatus` function that needs to be refactored to use specific methods
- Line 483: Passes status change handler that should be updated

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. Update frontend components to use specific booking status methods instead of the deprecated `updateBookingStatus()`
2. Implement a proper `/v2/dashboard/stats` endpoint if more complex aggregations are needed

### Medium Priority
1. Fix the hardcoded merchant lookup in public controllers (currently using `findFirst({ where: { status: 'ACTIVE' } })`)
2. Add proper merchant identification for multi-tenant scenarios

### Low Priority
1. Add V2 endpoints for any other V1 functionality that might be missing
2. Review and update integration tests for V2 endpoints

## API Version Routing
The system uses automatic version prefixing:
- `/bookings/*` routes → `/v2/bookings/*`
- All other routes → `/v1/*`
- Public routes → `/api/public/*` (no version)

## Summary
The migration to V2 bookings with CQRS and Outbox patterns is mostly complete. The main issues were:
1. A bug in pagination handling (fixed)
2. Missing public endpoint (added)
3. Frontend still calling removed V1 endpoints (updated to use V2 with proper fallbacks)
4. Generic status update replaced with specific actions (added compatibility layer)

No broken imports or module dependencies were found. The system should now work properly with the V2 bookings module.
