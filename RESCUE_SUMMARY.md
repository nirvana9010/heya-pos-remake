# Heya POS Rescue Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Crashes (Critical)
**Problem**: API was crashing due to invalid date validation in booking service  
**Solution**: Added proper date validation with fallback to current date
```typescript
// Fixed in: apps/api/src/bookings/bookings.service.ts
let viewDate: Date;
if (!date) {
  viewDate = new Date(); // Default to today
} else {
  viewDate = new Date(date);
  if (isNaN(viewDate.getTime())) {
    viewDate = new Date(); // Default to today if invalid
  }
}
```

### 2. Dialog Box Not Opening
**Problem**: Service dialog in merchant app wasn't displaying  
**Solution**: Removed conditional rendering that was hiding the dialog
```typescript
// Fixed in: apps/merchant-app/src/app/services/page.tsx
// Changed from: {false && (<Dialog>...)} 
// To: <Dialog open={isAddDialogOpen}>...
```

### 3. Missing Static Assets
**Problem**: Placeholder avatar image causing 404 errors  
**Solution**: Used inline SVG data URL instead of external file
```typescript
// Fixed in: apps/merchant-app/src/components/layout/topbar.tsx
src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg..."
```

### 4. Port Configuration
**Status**: Ports were already configured correctly
- API: 3000
- Merchant App: 3002
- Booking App: 3001  
- Admin Dashboard: 3003

## Current Status

✅ **API**: Running stable on port 3000
- Health endpoint working
- Authentication working (username: HAMILTON, password: demo123)
- Services, Customers, and Bookings endpoints functioning
- WebSocket support ready

✅ **Merchant App**: Running on port 3002
- Login functional
- Service dialog fixed and working
- Dashboard, customers, and calendar views accessible

✅ **Database**: SQLite with seed data
- Test merchant created
- Sample services and customers loaded
- Ready for development

## Quick Start

1. **Start the API**:
```bash
cd heya-pos
npm run api:dev
```

2. **Start Merchant App**:
```bash
npm run merchant:dev
```

3. **Login Credentials**:
- Username: `HAMILTON`
- Password: `demo123`

## Key Commands

- Build packages: `npm run build`
- Seed database: `cd apps/api && npm run prisma:seed`
- Test API: `node test-api.js`
- Stop all: `npm run stop:all`

## Important Notes

1. Always build packages before starting API if you get module errors
2. The monorepo structure requires careful dependency management
3. Use the provided npm scripts rather than direct commands
4. Database is SQLite for development (PostgreSQL for production)

## Next Steps

The app is now functional and ready for continued development. Core features are working:
- Authentication flow
- Service management with dialogs
- Customer database
- Booking system
- Real-time updates infrastructure

Focus on enhancing features rather than fixing infrastructure issues.
